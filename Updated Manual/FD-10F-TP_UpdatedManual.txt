# Labfreez FD-10F-TP Freeze Dryer User Manual

## Introduction to Freeze Drying

Freeze drying (lyophilization) is a dehydration process used to preserve sensitive materials by first freezing them and then removing the ice by sublimation under vacuum. In sublimation, water transitions directly from solid ice to vapor without melting into liquid, which avoids heat damage to the product. This gentle drying method preserves the material’s structure and potency, making it ideal for pharmaceuticals. By freeze-drying peptide-based active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with suitable excipients (stabilizers, bulking agents), we obtain a stable, dry powder “cake” in each vial that can be stored at room temperature for extended periods without degradation.

**How it works:** The freeze-dryer’s refrigeration system first **freezes** the product, solidifying nearly all water into ice. Next, in **primary drying**, the chamber pressure is lowered (vacuum applied) and the shelves are gently heated. Under vacuum, the ice in the product **sublimes** (evaporates as vapor) and travels to the condenser (cold trap), where it re-freezes as ice on the coils. This removes the majority of water (\~95% of total) from the product. Finally, in **secondary drying**, the product is warmed further under vacuum to drive off remaining **bound moisture** by desorption. After drying, an inert gas (e.g. nitrogen) is introduced to break the vacuum, and rubber stoppers are fully seated into the vials while still under partial vacuum – yielding **vacuum-stoppered** lyophilized vials.

**Why freeze drying?** Lyophilization is preferred for sensitive biomolecules like peptides, proteins, vaccines, and other injectables. In liquid form, these molecules can degrade or lose potency over time, but freeze-drying converts them into a stable powder form, greatly extending shelf life. The process avoids the high heat of traditional drying (which could denature proteins or cause chemical breakdown) by exploiting sublimation at low temperature. The resulting porous, dried “cake” in the vial can be easily reconstituted with sterile water or buffer to its original state. Freeze-drying also allows **sterile processing** (vials are stoppered under vacuum before full exposure to the environment) and produces a light, porous product that dissolves quickly when rehydrated. Common applications include preparing peptide APIs, antibodies, hormones, antibiotics, plasma products, and vaccines as lyophilized injectables, as well as preserving biological samples and food products.

**Key principles:** Successful freeze-drying relies on understanding the product’s thermal characteristics. Each formulation has a **eutectic or collapse temperature** – the highest temperature it can withstand in the frozen state without melting or collapsing. During primary drying, the shelf temperature must stay below this critical temperature to maintain product structure. For crystalline materials, this limit is the eutectic point; for amorphous formulations, it’s the glass transition (Tg′) or collapse temperature. Exceeding these can cause the product matrix to collapse into a melted or cakey mess, ruining the batch. Conversely, drying too slowly (shelf too cold or vacuum too high) prolongs cycle time unnecessarily. Thus, developing an optimal **lyophilization recipe** means balancing temperature, pressure, and time to remove water efficiently while protecting product quality.

Additionally, techniques like **annealing** can be employed during the freezing phase. Annealing is an optional step where the product, after initial freezing, is briefly warmed to a subzero temperature (above its crystallization temperature) and held, then refrozen. This allows ice crystals to grow larger and can improve drying by increasing pore size in the product matrix. For example, a peptide formulation with amorphous excipients might be rapidly frozen to -50°C, then annealed at -20°C for a couple of hours to encourage crystallization of certain components, reducing resistance to vapor flow in primary drying. Annealing must be done carefully (typically at a temperature just above the formulation’s Tg′, e.g. -15 to -10°C, for a few hours) so that the product remains solid but achieves a more orderly ice structure. We will discuss how such steps are programmed into the recipe in later sections.

In summary, freeze drying works by **freezing** the product, **vacuuming** out the air, and **gently heating** to remove water by sublimation. This preserves the peptide API’s integrity and potency, yielding a dry, stable product. The Labfreez FD-10F-TP pilot freeze dryer is specifically designed to accomplish this with precision control and is equipped with a **Lyo-Pilot Control System** that allows users to program and monitor each phase of the process.

## Safety Guidelines

Operating a freeze dryer involves low temperatures, vacuum pressures, and complex machinery. **Safety is paramount.** Before using the FD-10F-TP, read the following guidelines and understand the rationale behind each:

* **Training and Authorization:** Only trained personnel should operate the freeze dryer. Log in with the appropriate user role (Operator or Admin) and never bypass login security. This ensures users have the correct permissions and knowledge to use the equipment safely.

* **Electrical Safety:** The FD-10F-TP is a heavy-duty appliance (around 2 kW power). Ensure it’s connected to a properly rated outlet (220 V with grounding) and avoid using extension cords. Keep the area around the power cord dry. Do not open panels or attempt to service electrical components while the unit is powered – there are high voltages for the compressor, heaters, and circulation pump. Always turn off and unplug the unit before any maintenance on internal parts.

* **Vacuum Safety:** The freeze dryer creates a strong vacuum (down to \~5 Pa). The chamber is a robust pressure vessel designed for vacuum; do not modify it or use damaged components. Make sure the acrylic door and its gasket are in good condition with no cracks or dirt that might prevent a proper seal. A poor seal not only ruins your drying process but can also cause the vacuum pump to pull in air continuously (overheating the pump and risking oil back-streaming). Never attempt to open the chamber door when the chamber is under vacuum – first break the vacuum to atmospheric pressure *slowly* via the vent valve (or inert gas backfill) to equalize pressure. Rapidly admitting air can cause glass vials to **crack or eject stoppers** and can dislodge dried product (the powder may blow out of the vial). Always release vacuum gently and in a controlled manner.

* **Cryogenic and Thermal Safety:** During operation, parts of the system become **extremely cold** (down to -80°C on shelves or condenser) and others hot (heaters up to +65°C). Use insulated gloves when handling any materials that have been in the chamber or touching the shelves/condenser shortly after a run. Avoid direct skin contact with the cold inner chamber or any frost – it can cause instant frostbite. Similarly, be cautious of hot surfaces like the heater assembly or vacuum pump exhaust. Allow sufficient time for components to return to safe temperatures before maintenance or cleaning. The software’s **Defrost** function will heat the condenser to melt ice; do not touch the condenser during defrost and ensure the drain is directed to a container to catch hot water.

* **Sample and Glassware Handling:** When freeze-drying in vials, use only high-quality borosilicate glass vials designed for lyophilization and **do not overfill them** (typically fill to no more than \~30-50% of vial volume). Overfilling can cause vials to crack upon freezing (water expands) or cause “boil over” when drying. Always **partially insert stoppers** (halfway pressed in) during drying so that vapor can escape but the stopper can be fully seated later. If using any other containers, ensure they are rated for low temperatures and vacuum. For example, if using flasks with adapters, check that all connections (hoses, valves) are secure and that the glassware has no chips. Vacuum implosion is a risk if a flask has a flaw – always inspect for damage and consider using protective shielding for any external containers.

* **Chemical Safety:** The FD-10F-TP is intended primarily for aqueous solutions (buffers, peptide solutions, etc.). **Avoid organic solvents** or highly volatile chemicals unless the machine is specifically equipped to handle them. Organic solvents (e.g. acetonitrile, tert-butanol) can attack gaskets and vacuum pump oil, and their vapors might pose fire or toxicity hazards. If you must lyophilize a formulation with a co-solvent, ensure the condenser is cold enough to trap it and that the vacuum pump exhaust is properly filtered/ventilated. Never freeze-dry flammable solvents without an inert atmosphere and appropriate precautions. When in doubt, consult safety data sheets and consider a chemical trap or sorbent to capture vapors before they reach the pump.

* **Environment and Ventilation:** Operate the freeze dryer in a well-ventilated area. The vacuum pump will vent out gases (and potentially a fine oil mist if not using an oil mist filter). Good ventilation prevents accumulation of any fumes. Keep the area around the unit clear of clutter. The compressor and fan need airflow (at least a few inches of clearance around vents) to dissipate heat; otherwise, overheating could trip safety cut-offs or shorten component life. Also, maintain ambient room temperature within the recommended range (typically 15–25°C) for optimal performance – extreme heat can reduce cooling efficiency, and extreme cold could affect the electronics.

* **Emergency Procedures:** In an emergency (for example, if you hear unusual loud noises, see smoke, or suspect a serious malfunction), **stop the operation immediately**. Use the software controls or the emergency stop (if provided) to shut down power to the compressor and heater. Vent the chamber if it’s safe to do so, and turn off the main power. Report the issue to maintenance. The software will log alarms (e.g. over-pressure, sensor failure); use those logs in diagnosing the problem but do not continue operation until the cause is resolved. Keep a Class C fire extinguisher nearby (for electrical fires), though fire risk is low if the unit is used properly.

* **Operational Best Practices:** Always ensure the **condenser drain valve** is closed before starting a run (a common oversight that causes failure to hold vacuum). Double-check that the vacuum pump is switched on (some models require manually powering the pump, though on this unit it’s PLC-controlled). It’s good practice to **pre-freeze** samples (either in a separate freezer or using the freeze dryer shelves) before applying vacuum – this prevents product from boiling over. If you pre-freeze outside, transfer vials quickly to the pre-cooled shelf to minimize any thaw. Also pre-cool the condenser to at least -40°C before vacuum startup (more on that in the Operation section). **Never** leave the freeze dryer running unattended for the first time without monitoring, in case parameters need adjustment. Finally, **read the manual carefully before operation** (as the startup screen wisely reminds you) to avoid costly mistakes!

By following these safety guidelines and using the FD-10F-TP as intended, you will protect yourself, your colleagues, and your product from harm. Always err on the side of caution: if unsure about a procedure or an alarm message, pause and consult a supervisor or expert. Safety interlocks (like door seals, vacuum release valves, and software alarms) are there to help – do not bypass or disable them. With proper care and attention to safety, freeze drying can be a routine and incident-free process.

## Step-by-Step Installation and Setup

Setting up the Labfreez FD-10F-TP freeze dryer correctly is essential for safe operation and optimal performance. Follow this step-by-step guide when installing the unit and preparing it for use:

1. **Unpacking and Placement:** Upon delivery, carefully unpack the freeze dryer and the separate vacuum pump (if included separately). The FD-10F-TP is a pilot-scale unit (\~210 kg), so use appropriate equipment and team lifting to position it. Place the unit on a **level, sturdy surface** in a clean, indoor area. Ensure there is at least \~15–30 cm (6–12 inches) of clearance at the sides and back for airflow (the compressor’s air-cooled condenser needs space to dissipate heat). The environment should be dry and between 15–25°C. Avoid areas with corrosive fumes or excessive dust. Lock the castor wheels (if present) once the unit is in place to prevent rolling.

2. **Power Requirements:** Verify the electrical requirements. The FD-10F-TP typically runs on 220 V, 50 Hz (can be configured for 110 V/60 Hz if specified). Ensure your outlet matches the voltage and is on a dedicated circuit (the unit draws about 2 kW, so roughly 10 A at 220 V). Plug the freeze dryer’s power cable into the outlet and turn on the main power switch (often a rocker or key switch on the back or side of the unit). There may be indicator lights showing power status. Do **not** turn on the refrigeration or vacuum systems yet – that will be done via the software interface after setup.

3. **Vacuum Pump Installation:** The FD-10F-TP uses a two-stage rotary vane vacuum pump to achieve deep vacuum. Position the vacuum pump on the floor near the freeze dryer (to minimize hose length and bends). Ensure the pump is upright and stable. Connect the pump’s inlet to the freeze dryer’s vacuum port using the provided vacuum hose and clamps. The connection should be air-tight; tighten clamps firmly and check that the hose is not kinked. Before first use, **check the vacuum pump oil level**: use the sight glass on the pump to ensure oil is filled to the indicated line. If low, add the recommended vacuum pump oil (usually a DC-704 or similar) to the proper level. Also verify the pump’s exhaust mist filter (if installed) is in place – this reduces oil vapor in the room. Do not run the pump without oil, as it will be damaged. Keep the pump’s power switch off for now; it will be controlled later.

4. **Condenser Drain Connection:** The unit has a drain port for removing condensate (melted ice) from the condenser chamber. Locate the drain valve (often at the bottom or side of the condenser). Make sure this valve is **closed** (turn to the closed position) before starting any operation – if left open, you cannot pull a vacuum. Attach a drain hose to this port and place the other end in a suitable container or floor drain to collect water during defrost. This hose should not be kinked or elevated too high (water should be able to flow out by gravity when the valve is opened). Confirm that the drain valve is leak-tight when closed.

5. **Shelf Assembly and Loading (if applicable):** The FD-10F-TP comes with shelf/tray assembly installed (for the stoppering model, there is typically one shelf platen on a hydraulic/electric mechanism for vial stoppering). If multiple shelves or trays were shipped separately, install them according to the manual (usually sliding into the chamber’s side rails). Ensure that the shelf temperature probes are connected (there may be a wired connector for shelf temperature sensor and heater power – these are typically pre-connected). For initial testing, do not place any product in the chamber yet; keep it empty. However, you may place some clean dummy vials or a small flask to simulate load if you plan to test performance.

6. **Inert Gas Supply (optional):** If you plan to backfill and stopper vials under inert gas (e.g., nitrogen), set up the gas supply now. Connect a cylinder of dry Nitrogen (or other inert gas as required) to the inlet valve (typically labeled “Gas” or “Vent Valve”). This connection might be a hose barb or a compression fitting. Use the proper regulator on the gas cylinder, set initially to a low delivery pressure (e.g., \~0.1–0.2 MPa or as instructed by Labfreez). Do **not** open the gas supply yet. The inert gas will be used at the end of the cycle to vent and stoppering – it must be dry and oil-free gas to avoid contaminating your product.

7. **Software Installation/Startup:** The FD-10F-TP is controlled by the Lyo-Pilot (aka Lyo-Control) software, typically via a built-in touchscreen PC or an external computer connected to the unit’s PLC. If using an external PC, install the FD-LYO control software according to Labfreez instructions and connect the communication cable (likely an Ethernet or USB-to-serial) from the PC to the freeze dryer’s control port. Turn on the computer and launch the **Lyo-Pilot Control System** application. You will see a startup/login window (as shown in Figure 1-1 below). If the control panel is integrated (touchscreen), simply power on the freeze dryer and the control interface should boot up to the login screen.

&#x20;*Figure 1-1. Startup screen (User Login dialog). This is the first screen of the Lyo-Pilot software. Select a **User** role on the left and enter the corresponding password to log in. Roles include Admin, Operator, Parameters, and Vendor, each with different access levels. “Admin” (as shown selected) has full privileges to configure system settings and user accounts; “Operator” is for day-to-day running of recipes; “Parameters” and “Vendor” modes are typically reserved for advanced configuration, calibration, or service personnel. The login dialog also allows setting logout timers (online/idle timeout) and shows a description of the selected user group. Ensure you log in with the correct role – for routine use, an **Operator** account is recommended (limited authority but enough to run recipes). The software may have default passwords (refer to vendor documentation), which you should change for security once setup. Always read any startup messages or warnings (note the reminder: “please read the manual carefully before operation!” at bottom).*

8. **Initial System Check:** After login, you will arrive at the main control screen of the software (Figure 1-2). Before running any drying process, take a moment to verify that the system is communicating properly and that all sensors read nominal values. On the main screen, check that the **chamber pressure (vacuum)** reading is around ambient pressure (it might show 0.0 Pa if not yet calibrated or if the sensor maxed out at atmosphere – some sensors read 0 at atm if out of range). The **shelf temperature** reading should be around room temperature initially (assuming the shelf is at ambient, you might see \~20–25°C displayed). The condenser temperature might also read ambient if no cooling yet. Confirm there are no active alarm indicators (no “Communication Error” or other fault messages on screen). If you see a “Communication Error” banner, it means the software isn’t connecting to the PLC/hardware – check your cable or restart the software.

&#x20;*Figure 1-2. Main Control Screen (system overview). This is the primary interface for monitoring the freeze dryer. The screen features a schematic diagram of the freeze-drying system and real-time readouts: on the left panel, key values are listed such as **Recipe Name** (current loaded recipe ID), **Chamber VAC** (chamber vacuum pressure in Pa), **Current Step** of the running recipe, and timers (time set for the current step, time elapsed, and total running time). In the main diagram (center/right), each component of the freeze dryer is illustrated: the **drying chamber** (left) with shelf apparatus, the **condenser/cold trap** (right), the **vacuum pump** (rightmost icon), **compressor** (bottom right), and circulating fluid system (pump and heater at bottom left). Each component icon may light up or animate when active (e.g., the vacuum pump icon might highlight when pumping, the heater icon glows when heating). The shelf and condenser temperature readings are also shown in the diagram – for example, “0.0” in the shelf block and condenser block indicate current temperatures (Process Value, PV). The labels “PV” and “SV” near the shelf correspond to **Process Value** (actual shelf temp) and **Set Value** (target shelf temp) so you can compare actual vs. setpoint. At the top, the software version (Ver1.5) and the system date/time are displayed. Use this main screen to verify all subsystems: e.g., ensure the **circulation pump** and **Chamber Chill/Condenser Chill** indicators show as off initially, and that the emergency-stop or any interlocks are not tripped (they would likely raise an alarm if so).*

9. **Sensor Calibration (optional check):** The FD-10F-TP system has a sensor calibration function, though new units come calibrated from the factory. At installation, you typically do not need to perform calibration unless you suspect a reading is off. However, it’s good to confirm the readings make sense: for example, you can compare the shelf temperature reading with an independent thermometer at room temperature (they should agree within a few degrees). Similarly, chamber vacuum reading at atmosphere might read \~0 Pa if the sensor is a low-range gauge – it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s wrong, just out of range. If calibration is needed, it usually involves logging in as “Parameters” or “Admin” and entering known reference values (consult Labfreez documentation). For initial setup, assume calibration is correct and proceed.

10. **Test Vacuum Integrity (dry run):** Before drying actual product, it’s wise to do a trial run empty. First, **pre-cool the condenser**: you can do this by starting the refrigeration manually. Use the **Manual Operation** screen (we will cover it in detail later, see Figure 1-7) to turn on the **Compressor** and **Condenser Chill** functions. In manual mode, set the shelf to a low temperature or simply leave the shelf off for now, as we only want to test vacuum and condenser. Let the condenser cool for at least 30 minutes until the condenser temperature (on main screen) drops to \~ -50°C or lower (the colder the condenser, the better it will trap moisture). Once sufficiently cold, ensure the chamber door is fully closed and latched, then turn on the **Vacuum Pump** (again via manual controls). Watch the chamber pressure reading. It should start dropping rapidly. On a tight system, you’ll see it fall below, say, 100 Pa within a minute, and eventually approach the ultimate vacuum spec (<5 Pa) after several minutes. Listen for any hissing sounds which indicate leaks. If vacuum is not dropping well (stuck at high values), hit “Stop” and check seals (door O-ring, drain valve, etc.) – common culprits are the door not fully tightened or the drain not fully closed. This dry vacuum test not only checks for leaks but also helps outgas any moisture inside. After reaching a good vacuum, you can turn off the vacuum pump (vent the chamber first by slowly opening the gas/vent valve to break vacuum). Turn off the compressor and allow the condenser to warm back up (or use the **Defrost** function to speed up melting any frost that accumulated). Drain the water if any. Now you have confirmed the system is working properly under vacuum.

With installation and initial checks complete, you are ready to load product and proceed with creating freeze-drying recipes and running the machine. Always ensure that for every run, you’ve done a quick pre-run checklist (door closed, valves closed, pump oil OK, software connected, etc.) as illustrated above. In the next sections, we will explore the software interface in depth and then walk through actually executing a freeze-drying cycle for a peptide product.

## Software Interface Walkthrough (Lyo-Pilot Control System)

The Labfreez FD-10F-TP is operated through the **Lyo-Pilot Control System** software, which provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for all functions: setting up recipes (drying programs), controlling the equipment manually, monitoring progress, and performing maintenance. In this section, we present a visual walkthrough of the entire interface using screenshots from the system. Each subsection corresponds to a major screen or feature in the software. Understanding the interface is crucial for successful operation, as you will frequently switch between these screens to configure and monitor the freeze-drying process.

### Startup/Login Screen

*(Refer to Figure 1-1 above.)* When you launch the Lyo-Pilot software, the first thing you see is the **User Login** dialog. As described earlier, this screen prompts for a username (by role) and password. The FD-10F-TP has multiple user levels: Admin, Operator, Parameters, Vendor. Use the arrow or click to select the appropriate role. For day-to-day operations, select **Operator** and enter the password. If this is the first use, default passwords may be provided by the manufacturer (ensure to change them later for security). The Admin role can create or authorize other users and has access to all settings (use Admin carefully – e.g., only Admin can calibrate sensors or change system parameters, which if done incorrectly could affect performance). The Parameters/Vendor roles are typically for service engineers; these might bypass certain interlocks or allow low-level control, so do not use them unless instructed by technical support.

In the login dialog, you can also set **logout behavior**: “Online timeout” means the software will auto-logout after the specified “Online time” (in minutes) elapses, presumably requiring re-entry of password if you remain connected; “Idle timeout” logs out after a period of inactivity. For training purposes, you might disable timeouts, but in a GMP environment, it’s good to enforce automatic logouts for security. The **USB login** button (grayed out in the screenshot) suggests the system can use a USB dongle or key for authentication (likely for vendor/tech use). After entering credentials, press **Login** to access the main interface. If the credentials are wrong, you’ll remain on this screen (consult your supervisor if passwords are lost – there may be a password reset procedure via the Admin account).

### Main Interface – Overview Diagram

*(Refer to Figure 1-2 above.)* After logging in, the **Main screen** is displayed. This is the heart of the user interface for real-time monitoring. Let’s break down its features:

* **Status Panel (left side):** This column displays key status indicators and the loaded recipe info. “Recipe Name” shows the ID or name of the currently selected recipe (in the screenshot it’s `0`, meaning either recipe #0 or none loaded). “Chamber VAC” displays the current vacuum pressure in the chamber in Pascals. In Figure 1-2, it reads 0.0 Pa because the system is at atmosphere (the vacuum sensor registers 0 when no vacuum is drawn). Once the pump is on, you will see this value drop (e.g., 500 Pa, 100 Pa, down towards a few Pa). **Note:** 1 Pa ≈ 0.0075 torr (mmHg). Atmospheric pressure is \~101,000 Pa, but our sensor maxes at 1000 Pa on the graph, so “0.0 Pa” essentially indicates >1000 Pa (no vacuum). The panel also shows “Current Step” of the recipe (when a recipe is running, this will update as the cycle progresses through steps). Below that, “Time Set” shows the programmed duration of the current step, “Running Time” shows how much time has elapsed in the step, and “Total Running Time” is the cumulative time since the start of the recipe. In idle state, these are 0. The **Menu** button at the bottom opens the main menu – from which you can navigate to all other screens (Recipe setup, Manual operation, etc.).

* **System Diagram (center/right):** The main area is a schematic diagram of the freeze dryer’s components, providing at-a-glance status:

  * The **Drying Chamber** is depicted on the left side of the diagram by a rectangular vessel containing horizontal plates (shelves). In the figure, two shelf icons are shown, though in the stoppering model there is physically one shelf – the diagram likely is generic. The number shown inside (0.0) is the shelf temperature in °C (Process Value). When the shelf is being controlled, you’ll also see the Set Value (SV) next to PV as shown (both 0.0 in the idle screenshot). If heating or cooling is active, this display updates in real-time.
  * On top of the chamber icon, there is a vertical piston/cylinder graphic – this likely represents the **stoppering mechanism** (a hydraulic or mechanical piston that can press the shelf up to stopper vials). In routine operation, you won’t directly control it via the main screen, but be aware it’s shown (it may move or change color when activated).
  * Between the chamber and condenser, a small valve icon is shown (with a horizontal bar) – that is the **vapor port** isolation valve. It connects or isolates the drying chamber and condenser. In most cycles, this valve remains open to allow vapor flow to the condenser; it might close when ending the cycle or for certain CIP (clean-in-place) procedures. If the software detects certain conditions, it might show that valve status. Generally, ensure this is open during drying (the software handles it automatically when you start a recipe).
  * The **Condenser (Cold Trap)** is shown as the second chamber on the right of the diagram. Inside it, a coil or set of cold surfaces is indicated, with “Condenser Chill” label and a snowflake icon. The number 0.0 here would be the condenser temperature in °C (if the system has a sensor on the condenser). When the refrigeration is running, this will drop (e.g., to -70°C). In the figure, “Chamber Chill” is also labeled near a valve-like symbol on the refrigeration line going to the shelf. The system likely has two cooling circuits or solenoid controls: one for condenser cooling and another to cool the shelf via circulating fluid. “Condenser Chill” may refer to the cooling path to the condenser, and “Chamber Chill” to cooling the shelves.
  * The **Compressor** is drawn at bottom-right (with a red motor icon). This is the refrigeration compressor. When it runs, you might hear it and the icon could highlight. It provides cooling to both the condenser and shelf (through a heat exchanger) as needed.
  * The **Vacuum Pump** is the grey device to the far right with another red motor icon. Similarly, when the pump is on, this may light up. The vacuum line runs from the chamber to the pump (through a filter/trap if any, not explicitly shown).
  * On the bottom left, the **Circulation Pump** (yellow icon with red top, perhaps drawn like a motor/pump) and a **Heater** (green zigzag icon) represent the thermal fluid system for shelf temperature control. The FD-10F-TP (silicone oil heating version) circulates silicone oil through the shelf plate. When heating is required, an electric heater element warms the oil (the green heater icon), and the circulation pump distributes it through the shelf. When cooling, the refrigeration system (via Chamber Chill valve) cools the oil loop. The “PV/SV” display next to the shelf indicates how well the control loop is maintaining the target.
  * Various **Indicators:** Expect that when a component is active, its icon might change color (e.g., the “ON” states might be green or red lights on the buttons, though the specifics depend on the software design). The top-left “Communication Error” field will flash red if the PC-to-PLC communication is lost during operation – if you see that, no component control will work, and you should troubleshoot the connection immediately.

* **Date/Time and Version (top):** Always verify that the system clock is correct (especially if data logging or recipe events need proper timestamps). If the date/time is wrong, adjust it in the Windows system settings or PLC settings as applicable (Admin rights likely needed). The software version (Ver1.5 in this case) is good to note in documentation or if seeking support, as features may differ in other versions.

In summary, the main screen is your dashboard to view current conditions. You cannot directly change settings here (no input fields on this screen except the Menu button), but it reflects any changes made elsewhere (like if you start a recipe, you’ll see “Current Step” become 1 and times counting down). Make it a habit to glance at the main screen to ensure everything is as expected (for example, during a run, check that the shelf PV is near the SV, check that chamber pressure is at setpoint, etc.). Any abnormal reading (like shelf temperature not changing when it should, or pressure rising unexpectedly) can be spotted here and investigated.

### Creating and Editing a Freeze-Dry Recipe

One of the most important tasks is to configure a **recipe** (also called a cycle or program) that defines the freeze-drying process steps for your peptide product. The FD-10F-TP allows you to store multiple recipes (up to 32 programs, each with many segments) in memory. We will now walk through the **Recipe Parameter** screens where you create or edit these recipes. The interface for recipe editing is split across three screens to accommodate a large number of steps.

**Navigating to Recipe Setup:** Click the **Menu** button on the main screen, and select the option for **Recipe Parameters** (it might be labeled as such or an icon). This opens the recipe editing interface. You will see fields to enter step parameters (time, temperature, vacuum) in a tabular form.

&#x20;*Figure 1-3. Recipe Parameter screen (Page I, steps 1–18). This screen is used to program the freeze-drying recipe step by step. Each row corresponds to a step. The columns are: “Step” number, “Running Time” (with separate inputs for Hours and Minutes), “Tem. Value” (the shelf temperature setpoint in °C for that step), and “Vacuum Value” (the chamber pressure setpoint in Pa for that step). On the right half, steps 10–18 are shown (the screen is split to show 1–9 on the left and 10–18 on the right, on the same page). At the top, you see a summary of “Total: 0Hr0Min” (total programmed duration of the recipe) and “Total Steps: 0” (number of steps currently defined) – these will update as you input values. “Vacuum Startup Step: 0” is a special parameter indicating at which step the vacuum pump will be turned on (more on this below). At the bottom, controls are provided: **Recipe Select** (set this to the recipe number slot you want to work on, 0 in this figure), **Recipe Save** (to save changes to that slot), **Recipe Name** (to assign or view the recipe’s name), arrow buttons (circular arrows) likely for navigating between pages of steps or loading default, and “Recipe A” / “Recipe B” which may be quick-load slots or compare buffers (in this software, Recipe A and B could allow you to temporarily hold two sets of parameters for comparison or copying – for simplicity, we can ignore A/B for now). The Menu button returns to main menu.*

To create a new recipe, choose an empty **Recipe Select** slot (0–31; here we chose 0). Enter each step one by one:

* For Step 1, click on the Hour/Min cells and input the duration of the first step. For example, if you want a 1 hour 30 min step, enter “1” under Hr and “30” under Min.
* Enter the desired shelf temperature for that step under “Tem. Value” (e.g., “-45” for -45 °C). Note: you can enter fractional degrees if needed, but typically integers are used.
* Enter the vacuum setpoint for that step under “Vacuum Value”. For steps where you **do not want vacuum applied (atmospheric)**, you have two options: either set Vacuum Value to 0 (or some placeholder) and specify that the vacuum pump starts later, *or* enter atmospheric pressure (like 100000 Pa) but since the system can’t actually hold atmosphere when closed, the usual method is to delay vacuum pump activation. This is where “Vacuum Startup Step” comes in – usually you set Vacuum Startup Step = the number of the first step where you want the vacuum pump turned on. For example, if steps 1 and 2 are freezing at atmospheric pressure, and you want vacuum to start at step 3, you’d set “Vacuum Startup Step: 3”. In the interface, you click on the Vacuum Startup Step value at the top and change it. This ensures the pump will remain off for steps 1–2, and only activate at the transition to step 3 (the software will automatically handle turning on the pump at that time). In our screenshot, it’s 0 since nothing is set yet.
* Continue to Step 2, Step 3, etc., filling out each required segment of your recipe.

If your recipe has more than 9 steps, use the interface’s page controls to view additional steps:
&#x20;*Figure 1-4. Recipe Parameter screen (Page II, steps 19–36). This shows the continuation for steps 19 through 36. The layout and procedure to input values are identical to Page I. Use the green arrow buttons at the bottom (between Recipe Name and Recipe A) to navigate between pages I, II, and III. In this screenshot, no values are filled (all 0) as it’s just an empty template. The “Total Steps” and “Vacuum Startup Step” at top still show 0, meaning we haven’t finalized anything yet. If you input data in Page I and then navigate here, those summary fields would update accordingly.*

If your protocol requires even more steps (for extremely complex cycles), the system actually supports up to 50 steps in a single recipe. A third page exists to define steps 37–50:
&#x20;*Figure 1-5. Recipe Parameter screen (Page III, steps 37–50). This page allows defining steps 37 through 50. Most lyophilization cycles won’t need this many segments, but the flexibility is there for intricate processes (such as very gradual ramping or holding at many intermediate setpoints). A unique feature on this page is the **Vacuum Heat Lower/Upper** and **Temp. Range** settings (bottom right panel). “Vacuum Heat Lower” and “Vacuum Heat Upper” are safety parameters in Pascals. They define a pressure range for enabling heaters – essentially a protection against heating the product when vacuum is insufficient. For example, you might set Vacuum Heat Lower = 20 Pa and Upper = 100 Pa. This could mean: do not allow shelf heating unless chamber pressure is below 100 Pa (to avoid boiling), and perhaps once below 20 Pa you can use full heating. This creates a hysteresis band ensuring that if vacuum rises (pressure >100 Pa), the system will cut heating to prevent product melt-back, and only resume heating when vacuum improves below 20 Pa. The exact logic (lower vs upper) is something to set according to product needs – a common practice is to not heat above certain pressure. For novices, you can leave these at default (or consult a scientist for appropriate values), but be aware they exist as a safeguard. “Temp. Range” likely refers to the acceptable deviation range in shelf temperature (in °C) – possibly an alarm or control parameter that if the shelf temp strays beyond this range from setpoint, it triggers a warning. Setting a reasonable Temp Range (e.g., 2–5°C) can alert you if the system can’t keep up with the setpoint (like if cooling is insufficient). These parameters ensure the recipe runs safely: they are set once per recipe, not per step.*

**Programming Example:** For a peptide API, a typical recipe might be:

* Step 1: Freeze at -45°C for 2 hours (no vacuum yet).
* Step 2: (Optional) Annealing – raise to -20°C for 1 hour (still no vacuum) to improve crystallization.
* Step 3: Re-freeze to -45°C for 30 min (to ensure everything is solid before vacuum).
* Step 4: **Primary Drying** – turn on vacuum (so Vacuum Startup Step = 4) and set shelf to -20°C, hold for 10 hours. Set Vacuum Value perhaps 20 Pa. This will remove ice by sublimation. (Condenser will be working hard collecting ice.)
* Step 5: Still primary drying – increase shelf to -10°C, hold 5 hours (pressure still \~20 Pa).
* Step 6: Transition to **Secondary Drying** – ramp shelf to +20°C (enter maybe 5 °C/hour ramp if ramping is done via successive small steps or using the “Slope Temp” control in manual mode – but since recipes here don’t explicitly do ramping between steps except by consecutive steps, you might approximate a ramp by multiple steps or just accept some overshoot). Hold at +20°C for 4 hours under deep vacuum (e.g., 10 Pa).
* Step 7: Final secondary dry – +25°C for 2 hours (ensure moisture <1%).
* Step 8: End – you might include a step to backfill: you cannot directly set a “vent” via this screen, but what you can do is plan to stop the recipe at this point and then manually vent with nitrogen. The recipe could end while still under vacuum. Alternatively, some advanced systems let you specify an “air backfill” as a last step; in our interface, you might simply stop or let it finish then use manual control to vent and stopper.

This is just an example; you will adjust times and temps based on your specific peptide formulation (consult R\&D data on the product’s freezing point and stability). Notice that each step’s **meaning** corresponds to a phase in the process:

* Steps 1–3: Freezing phase (no vacuum, subzero temps).
* Step 4–5: Primary drying (vacuum on, shelf kept below the collapse temp of product).
* Step 6–7: Secondary drying (vacuum on, higher shelf temp to drive off bound water).
* Step 8: could be a placeholder to stop or indicate process end.

**Using the interface:** Enter all these values in the grid. As you fill times, the “Total: Hr/Min” at top will sum up (so you can see total cycle length, e.g., maybe 20Hr0Min). The “Total Steps” will show 8 in this example. **Vacuum Startup Step** must be set to 4 in this example so that vacuum pump only starts at step 4. For steps 1–3, you can either leave the Vacuum Value column blank or put atmospheric pressure (some users put something like 99999 as a dummy). It’s important: if Vacuum Startup Step is used, the system knows to ignore vacuum setpoints until that step.

Once finished, press **Recipe Save**. This writes your parameters into that recipe number slot in memory. If you navigate away without saving, you’ll lose changes. After saving, you can also go to the **Recipe Name** screen to give it a meaningful name (so recipe 0 could be named “Peptide1\_v1” or “Bivalirudin\_cycle” etc. for easy identification).

### Naming and Managing Recipes

It’s easy to accumulate multiple recipes in the system, so giving them clear names is helpful. The **Recipe Name** screen lets you view and edit the names of all stored programs.

&#x20;*Figure 1-6. Recipe Name list. This screen lists recipe slots (0 through 32) and their assigned names. In this example image, every recipe just shows its number as its name (0, 1, 2, …) which means no custom names have been set yet. In practice, you will click on a slot and type in a descriptive name. For instance, for recipe #0 you might enter “Peptide-A 5% mannitol”, for #1 “Peptide-A fast cycle”, #2 “Peptide-B formulation” and so on. Use names that encode the product or key parameters. The interface likely allows text input via an on-screen keyboard or by connecting a physical keyboard. Once you type a name, it will show next to the number. The arrow button at top-left might be for scrolling if there were more than one page of recipes, but since 0–32 are all shown here (33 entries total, which covers the 32 possible plus 0), you can see all at once. After naming, hit the Menu or an OK button to return. The names you set here will then display on other screens (for example, the main screen “Recipe Name” field might show the name instead of the number).*

**Selecting a Recipe:** To use a recipe for a run, you need to select it. This can be done either from the Recipe Parameter screen (set Recipe Select to that number and possibly a “Load” or the act of selecting might auto-load it) or through a menu on the main screen or manual operation screen. Ensure the correct recipe is loaded before starting the cycle – the main screen’s “Recipe Name” field will confirm the loaded recipe (either by number or name). It’s good practice to double-check the steps after loading, to make sure you didn’t accidentally have an old version or wrong program.

**Copying and Modifying Recipes:** You can use an existing recipe as a template for a new one by loading it, then using Recipe Save to a different slot number after making tweaks. Unfortunately, the interface doesn’t explicitly say “copy”, but you can manually do so. The “Recipe A” and “Recipe B” buttons might allow loading two recipes into temporary buffers (A and B) to compare or copy between them (for example, some systems let you load recipe X into A, recipe Y into B, and then you can edit one while keeping the other visible, or swap quickly). Consult the detailed manual if needed, but as a beginner, you may not use those until you’re more advanced.

### Manual Operation Controls

While recipes (auto mode) are used for actual freeze-drying cycles, the FD-10F-TP also provides a **Manual Operation** mode. This allows you to turn individual components on/off and control the system manually. Manual mode is extremely useful for: initial setup (as we did for testing vacuum or pre-cooling), developing new processes (you might manually trial different shelf temperatures and vacuums to observe the product, then later formalize into a recipe), and troubleshooting. It’s also how you perform tasks like defrosting the condenser after a run, or emergency control of components.

Navigate to **Manual Operation** via the Menu. You will see a screen like this:

&#x20;*Figure 1-7. Manual Operation screen. This interface lets you toggle between automatic and manual control, activate individual components, and access system logs and certain utilities. In the top-left panel **Control Mode**, you have two radio buttons: “Auto” and “Manual”. In this screenshot, Auto is ON (green) and Manual is OFF (red), meaning the system is in automatic mode ready for recipe control. To take manual control, you would switch Manual to ON (which likely forces Auto to OFF). You typically can only do one or the other – for safety, the system may not allow you to override during an automatic run without stopping it. Just below, “Slope Temp.” Yes/No is another toggle – if “Yes” (ON) is selected, the system will apply temperature changes with a slope (ramp) rather than instantaneously. If “No” (OFF), any setpoint you apply to shelf will change immediately (which could potentially overshoot). For most uses, keep Slope = Yes, as it will ramp shelf temperature at a controlled rate. The rate might be a fixed value or configured elsewhere (commonly a few °C per minute) to avoid thermal shock to product.*

*On the right side, we have large buttons for each component:* **Compressor**, **Condenser Chill**, **Vacuum Pump**, **Heater**, and **Defrost**. These allow manual activation:

* **Compressor:** Turns the refrigeration compressor on or off. (When on, it will try to cool whatever circuits are open – either condenser or shelf cooling if their solenoids engage.)
* **Condenser Chill:** Likely a control for a solenoid valve or secondary compressor stage that specifically cools the condenser. Activating this might start cooling the condenser coil (and possibly also implicitly start the compressor if it’s not already on). In some systems, you must turn on Compressor *and* Condenser Chill to actually chill the condenser. The button might illuminate when active.
* **Vacuum Pump:** Turns the vacuum pump on or off. Use this to evacuate the chamber in manual mode.
* **Heater:** Turns on the shelf heater. Caution: Only use this if you have set a desired shelf temperature or you are actively controlling the temperature. If you just turn the heater on continuously, the shelf will heat without regulation (not sure if this system allows unregulated heating – likely pressing Heater simply enables the control loop to heat toward the set temp).
* **Defrost:** Activates the defrost routine. Typically, defrost will warm the condenser (either by circulating warm fluid or electrical heaters around the coil) to melt accumulated ice. Use this after a drying run to clear the ice. When Defrost is on, ensure the chamber is vented/open and the drain is open, because melting ice will produce water that needs to escape. The Defrost button may run a timed sequence or simply turn on condenser heaters until you stop it.

In the middle-lower portion, there are buttons **History Alarm**, **System Para.**, **Operation Log**, **Eutectic Curve**:

* **History Alarm:** Opens a log of past alarm events (with timestamps and codes). Very useful for troubleshooting – e.g., if a run aborted at night, you can see if an alarm (like “Vacuum low” or “Shelf Overheat”) triggered.
* **System Para.:** Opens the System Parameters screen (see next section) where maintenance timers and certain settings reside.
* **Operation Log:** Likely a chronological log of user operations and system state changes – for instance, when a recipe started/ended, when a user toggled manual controls, etc. This can help audit what happened.
* **Eutectic Curve:** This might be a specialized feature to determine the eutectic or collapse temperature of a product by controlled experimentation. Pressing it could lead to a routine where the system gradually heats a sample and monitors it to find phase change points. This is an advanced feature typically, and might require a special temperature probe in a sample vial. We won’t go deep into this here, but know that it’s available for development purposes.

At the bottom of Manual screen, we see fields **Manual FD Set Tem.: 0.0 °C** and **Defrost Safety Tem.: 0.0 °C**, with a red **Manual Start** button:

* **Manual FD Set Temp.:** This is where you can input a shelf temperature setpoint for manual mode. For example, if you want to manually hold the shelf at -40°C, you would enter -40.0 here. However, simply entering the number isn’t enough; you need to then initiate manual control.
* **Defrost Safety Temp.:** This likely is a safety cutoff temperature for defrost – perhaps ensuring the shelf or condenser doesn’t exceed a certain temperature. You might set, say, +30°C here so that defrost heating stops once that temp is reached to avoid overheating the chamber.
* **Manual Start (button):** After configuring any manual setpoints and toggling Manual mode on, you press Manual Start to execute your manual control settings. This might engage the control loop to maintain the Manual FD Set Temp, etc. Essentially, Manual Start puts the system in your control: you would typically first set Manual mode on (Auto off), then set a shelf temp (if you want to control shelf), maybe toggle vacuum or compressor as needed, then hit Manual Start to begin the manual sequence. If Manual mode is off, that button might do nothing or might actually start an auto recipe instead (the labeling is a bit confusing). Usually, “Manual Start” in this screen is used only when Manual is selected.

**Using Manual Mode:** Here are a few examples of how you might use manual controls:

* **Pre-cooling condenser before a run:** Switch to Manual mode, press Compressor ON and Condenser Chill ON. (The compressor might start automatically when you hit Condenser Chill if not, hit Compressor too). Watch the condenser temperature on main screen until it’s suitably low (e.g., -60°C). Then you can either start your recipe (switch back to Auto, load recipe, start it – many systems allow seamless transition or will prompt you). In some cases, you might just leave compressor on and start the recipe, the recipe will take over.
* **Manually freezing a product:** If you loaded vials and want to freeze them manually: In Manual mode, set a low shelf set temp (e.g., -50°C), ensure Slope Temp = Yes (for gradual cooling), then press Manual Start. The compressor and chamber chill will activate to drive shelf to -50°C and hold it there. You watch until product is frozen (maybe an hour). Then you could either manually start vacuum from here or stop manual mode and switch to auto recipe for drying.
* **Interrupting a cycle:** If you needed to stop an automatic recipe mid-way, you might press an “Abort” or stop button (not shown here, but likely accessible via menu or simply switching to Manual could abort auto). Then you can use manual controls to safely handle the situation (e.g., if you aborted while under vacuum, go to manual mode, turn off heater, turn off vacuum pump, then slowly vent via gas valve).
* **Defrosting:** After a cycle, once product is removed and the chamber is at atmospheric pressure and open, close the chamber door (or leave it open a crack for moisture to escape) and press Defrost in manual mode. Also open the drain valve. The condenser will warm, melting ice – keep an eye on the water level in drain container. You can stop defrost when all ice is gone (the condenser temperature will rise to near room temp, and you might hear water dripping). Make sure to stop Defrost and re-close the drain when done.

Always be cautious in manual mode – the software won’t necessarily stop you from doing conflicting actions. For example, do not turn the heater on full while the shelf is at room temp without vacuum – the heater will obey but your product could melt or foam because you’re essentially heating at atmospheric pressure (which is like boiling it). The Vacuum Heat Lower/Upper in recipe settings may not apply in manual, so it’s up to you to follow safe practices (e.g., only heat when vacuum is on and product is frozen, etc.). Manual mode is powerful but rely on your understanding of the process when using it.

When done with manual operations, you can switch back to Auto mode (turn Manual OFF, Auto ON). Typically, you would do this before starting an automatic recipe. Some systems require you to be in Auto mode to run a recipe at all.

### System Parameters (Maintenance Settings)

The System Parameters screen (accessed via **System Para.** button on Manual Operation or possibly via main menu) contains configuration for maintenance reminders and possibly other system-wide settings. Figure 1-8 shows what this looks like:

&#x20;*Figure 1-8. System Parameter maintenance screen. This example highlights maintenance timers for **Condenser Fan Clean** and **Vacuum Pump Oil Change**. The top section “Condenser Fan Clean” has fields for Year/Month/Day for “Start” and “Act.” (perhaps “Actual”). This likely works as follows: you input the last service date or next due date for cleaning the condenser’s cooling fan. For example, after installing the unit, you might plan to clean the fan in 6 months. You could set Start = (today’s date) and Act (due) = (today + 180 days). Or it might be that “Start” is when you last reset it and “Act.” is a countdown that the system fills in. The red indicator dot (top right) probably lights up when the current date matches or exceeds the set due date, reminding you to perform the cleaning. You have Start/Stop buttons to initiate or cancel the timer. In the lower section, “VAC Initial Oil Change” and “VAC Normal Oil Change” are timers for the vacuum pump oil. The manufacturer often recommends an initial oil change after a break-in period (e.g., after the first 25 hours of pump operation) and then regular oil changes at a certain interval (say every 100 or 200 hours of run time). You could set, for instance, Initial = 25 Hr and Normal = 100 Hr. The system likely counts the pump running hours internally. When the pump’s runtime exceeds these values, a red indicator (the little square) might light or an alarm triggers to remind you to change oil. There are Start/Stop buttons to reset these counters – after you change the oil, you’d hit Start to begin counting anew. If you hit Stop, it might pause the timer. In this screenshot, all values are 0 since not configured yet.*

Using this screen:

* After installation, decide on maintenance intervals. For vacuum pumps: a common practice is to do the **first oil change** relatively soon (e.g., 25–50 hours) to remove any contaminants from manufacturing, then subsequent changes maybe every 200–300 hours or every 3 months (whichever comes first). If your lab uses the dryer daily, you might accumulate 200 hours in a month or two. If usage is infrequent, change oil at least yearly regardless. Set the Initial and Normal fields accordingly (the system may allow only whole hours).
* For **Condenser fan cleaning**: dust can clog the fan and condenser fins, reducing cooling efficiency. A semi-annual or annual cleaning schedule is wise. For example, every 6 months vacuum out the condenser compartment. You could set Act. (next due) to a date 6 months out. The UI is a bit cryptic; you might set Start = today’s date of last cleaning, and when that passes maybe it triggers something. You might need to experiment how it wants dates. Likely, you enter a due date in Act. and press Start to arm the reminder.
* There might be other parameters not shown here (some systems have pages for sensor calibration offsets, password management, etc., but those could be under Admin menus or separate screens). As a first-time user, stick to using these maintenance timers and leave other system parameters at default unless instructed by the manufacturer.

**Remember:** These tools are to **help you** maintain the machine proactively. The software will not physically prevent operation when maintenance is due, but an alarm or indicator will remind you. Do not ignore these reminders – e.g., running the vacuum pump for too long without oil change can cause pump failure, and a clogged condenser fan can lead to poor vacuum and long dry times. We will cover maintenance procedures in detail in a later section, but be aware you have this nice feature to log and track key maintenance in the interface. Be sure to hit the Start button for a timer after performing the maintenance task so the countdown resets.

### Real-Time Monitoring – Temperature and Vacuum Curves

During a freeze-drying run, monitoring the progress is critical. The Lyo-Pilot software includes real-time graphing of temperature and pressure (vacuum) data. These graphs help you visualize what’s happening inside the chamber and can be used to determine end-points (like end of primary drying) and to ensure the process is proceeding as planned.

You can access the real-time curves via the menu (often a button labeled **Tem. Curve** or **Vacuum Curve** on the main screen, or from Manual Operation screen there were “Vacuum Curve” and “Tem. Curve” toggles). The software likely has two separate graph screens: one for temperature vs time and one for vacuum vs time. Let’s see them:

&#x20;*Figure 1-9. Real-time Temperature Curve screen. This graph plots temperature data over time. The Y-axis (left) is temperature in °C (from +100°C to -100°C in this view), and the X-axis is time. In the top-right, “X-axis length: 50 Min” indicates the time span currently shown is 50 minutes. You can adjust this window to see shorter or longer periods (common options might be 1 hour, 10 hours, etc.). The legend box (yellow background) lists the data series being plotted: Absolute clock (the timeline), Shelf Temp, Condenser Temp, Product Temp, Shelf Set. Each has a coordinate range (here -100 to +100°C) and current value. For example, Shelf Temp = -100.0\~100.0°C range, current value presumably something like 0°C (not visible behind highlight but likely 20°C or 0 if not updated). The colors: typically Black, Blue, etc., correspond to each curve. From the list, it appears **Shelf Temperature** might be plotted in **black**, **Condenser Temperature** in blue, **Product Temperature** in perhaps another color (maybe green or not currently used if no probe is connected), and **Shelf Setpoint** in red. In a running cycle, you would see colored lines drawing across the graph. At the bottom, the timeline axis shows actual timestamps (here from \~08:05 to 08:55 on 2025-01-17). The control buttons at bottom allow scrolling through time: the single bar |< or >| might jump to start or end of recorded data, the double << or >> might pan left or right. “Show Dialog” could open a dialog to select which curves to display (for instance, you might hide product temp if none). “Time Dialog” might allow setting the X-axis span (like change 50 min to some other value or switch to hours). “Vacuum Curve” button likely switches directly to the vacuum graph screen.*

This temperature graph is extremely useful. For instance, during primary drying you might see the shelf set (red) at -20°C, shelf actual (black) maybe oscillating slightly around -20 if control is good, condenser (blue) down at -50°C, and if you have a product thermocouple in one of the vials, product temp (say green) might be at -30°C initially (because evaporative cooling keeps it colder than shelf until dry). As drying progresses, the product temp will rise and eventually meet the shelf temp, indicating the end of ice sublimation (end of primary drying). We will discuss interpretation soon, but keep an eye on these trends.

To avoid data overload, you can perhaps disable some curves – e.g., if you didn’t connect a product sensor, that line might just read 0 or some constant; you could hide it via Show Dialog if available. The coordinate range will auto-scale or can be fixed; here it’s fixed -100 to +100 to capture full range.

&#x20;*Figure 1-10. Real-time Vacuum Curve screen. This graph shows the vacuum (pressure) in the chamber over time. The Y-axis is pressure in Pa, from 0 at bottom to 1000 Pa at top in this view. The legend indicates “Chamber VAC” is plotted (likely in teal/cyan color as indicated by the square). The current value is 0.0 Pa in this shot (again because we were at atm and sensor saturated). The X-axis length is also 50 Min by default. Timeline at bottom shows from \~08:06 to 08:56. The controls (Show Dialog, Time Dialog, Tem. Curve) function similarly; the “Tem. Curve” button will swap back to the temperature chart.*

On the vacuum graph during a run, you will typically see pressure drop when vacuum is first applied, then hold roughly steady (at the setpoint if there is active control or at the pump’s ultimate if not actively controlled). There may be slight rises during certain times, e.g., when product is releasing a lot of vapor (if the pressure control allows a slight rise or if the pump struggles momentarily). If using a controlled vacuum setpoint, the line will hover around that setpoint (with maybe a sawtooth pattern if a valve is modulating). For example, if primary drying is at 30 Pa, you’ll see a line near 30 on the graph. If secondary drying is at 10 Pa, later the line will drop further. If an incident happens (like a leak or you vented intentionally), you’ll see a spike up toward 1000 Pa (or off the chart if it goes atmospheric). These graphs are recorded in real-time and possibly can be saved/exported after the run (since the system has a built-in recorder with USB export).

**Tips for using the Graphs:**

* Familiarize yourself with toggling between Temp and Vacuum graphs, especially if you only have a single screen. You might open the temperature graph and then want to check vacuum – one click on “Vacuum Curve” brings that up, and vice versa.
* Use the Time Dialog to expand the view if you have a long process. For an entire 24-hour run, you may want to set X-axis length to, say, 1440 Min (which is 24 h) so you can see it all at once. Alternatively, the software might auto-scroll and you scroll back to see earlier.
* While the cycle is running, these graphs update continuously. You can observe the **shelf temperature ramping** at step transitions (you’ll see the Shelf Set (red) jump to a new target, and the Shelf Temp (black) gradually follow it if Slope is on or more quickly if Slope off). You will also see how well the condenser is keeping up – if Condenser Temp starts rising significantly during primary drying, it may indicate it’s getting overloaded with ice (should ideally stay very cold).
* Pressure curve can tell you about **drying progress**: often, towards end of primary drying, pressure in a controlled process might start to drop or you can try a “pressure rise test” (closing isolation valve briefly and seeing if pressure rises, which indicates remaining ice – advanced technique outside scope of basics).
* Use these graphs along with the **History Alarm** log: if an alarm occurs at a specific time, you can scroll the graph to that timestamp to see what was happening (e.g., a spike in temp or pressure).
* After a run, you can export the data via USB if needed for record-keeping or analysis (if FD-LYO software supports export, which it says it does).

### Best Practices and Common Interface Tips

Before we move on to running a full cycle, here are some best practices and tips related to using the software interface effectively, as well as common mistakes to avoid:

* **Double-Check Recipe Parameters:** Always review your entered recipe before starting a run. A small typo can be disastrous (e.g., accidentally setting +50°C instead of -50°C, or entering “1 Hr 00 Min” when you meant 10 hours). Look at the “Total Steps” and “Total Time” to ensure they make sense. It can help to have a written SOP or a checklist for the cycle that you compare against the screen. A quick scroll through all recipe pages (I, II, III) will confirm you didn’t leave stray values in any fields.

* **Vacuum Startup Step Usage:** As mentioned, set the Vacuum Startup Step in the recipe appropriately. A very common novice error is to forget to delay vacuum or to start vacuum too early. If vacuum is started while the product is still liquid (not fully frozen), the sudden pressure drop can cause the solution to boil explosively (aka “bumping”), blowing liquid out of vials and making a mess. Make sure the freezing steps have completed and the product is solid before vacuum engages. Typically, choose a Vacuum Startup Step after at least the primary freezing step. In many peptide product cycles, vacuum is started once the shelf has reached the low freeze temperature and maintained it for some time (ensuring all vials frozen). Err on the side of a slightly longer freeze hold if unsure – a few extra minutes is better than a blown batch.

* **Monitor During Initial Cycle Stages:** Pay extra attention at the start of a run. The transition from freezing to vacuum (primary drying start) is critical. Watch the pressure reading as the pump engages – it should drop smoothly. If you see it oscillating or not dropping, pause the process and check for leaks. Also watch the **product (if visible through the door)** when vacuum starts – if you see any bubbling or puffing of product, it might indicate either residual liquid or too high shelf temperature at that moment. You might need to stop, re-freeze and adjust recipe (for example, lower the shelf temp before vacuum, or reduce pressure more slowly if possible).

* **Use Slope Temperature for Setpoint Changes:** When creating recipes, the interface doesn’t explicitly have a “ramp rate” setting for each step (some sophisticated control systems do, but here each step assumes an instantaneous setpoint change). However, the **Slope Temp** control in Manual mode suggests that when active, the system might automatically ramp to new setpoints rather than jump. It’s not entirely clear if Slope Temp applies to auto recipes (it might, possibly as a global setting). If it does, keep it ON so that when you transition from, say, -40°C to +20°C over one step change, the controller will not just drive straight to +20 as fast as possible but instead will raise it gradually (perhaps at a fixed slope). This prevents product stress. If the system doesn’t inherently ramp, then break your recipe into smaller increments. For example, instead of jumping from -20 to +20 in one step, you could do -20 to 0 in one step, then 0 to +20 in the next, each with some time to mimic a ramp. The goal is to avoid thermal shock to the product (which can cause vial cracks or product charring) and to avoid sudden pressure bursts (heating too quickly can overwhelm the condenser momentarily).

* **Naming Conventions:** Use the Recipe Name feature to keep track of your cycles. It’s far too easy to confuse “Recipe 1” vs “Recipe 2” unless you name them. For example, you might name them by product and date or by formulation. When you load a recipe, verify the name on main screen matches what you intended to run. This can prevent running the wrong cycle on a valuable batch.

* **Communication Status:** Keep an eye on the “Communication Error” indicator (top of screens). If you ever see it turn red during a run, it means the PC lost connection to the dryer (could be a loose cable or software crash). In such cases, the PLC usually continues the program autonomously (especially if it’s a PLC-based system, it might have fail-safes). But you should resolve comms ASAP – try to reconnect or restart the software. Typically, pressing Emergency Stop on the machine or cycling power is a last resort if controls are lost. Save your work (recipes) frequently to disk if possible, so you don’t lose them on a software crash.

* **Responding to Alarms:** If the system beeps or shows an alarm message, go to History Alarm to see what it is. Common alarms might include **Vacuum Fail** (if pressure didn’t reach setpoint in a certain time), **Power Fail** (if there was a brief outage), **Temperature Deviation** (if shelf temp strayed too far from setpoint), etc. Do not simply acknowledge and ignore – understand the cause. For example, a vacuum fail alarm might mean you left a valve open or the pump oil is low; fix the cause and you may be able to continue the run by reapplying vacuum (some cycles can recover if product stayed frozen).

* **User Error Prevention:** Some common user errors and how to avoid them:

  * Forgetting to close the drain valve → always check “Drain closed?” in a pre-start checklist.
  * Forgetting to open the isolation valve between condenser and chamber (if your system has a manual valve) → ensure any such valve is open when it should be (the FD-10F-TP likely has this automated).
  * Starting the recipe without the vacuum pump actually running (in manual systems) → the FD-10F-TP will auto start the pump at the programmed step, but ensure the pump’s power switch (on the hardware) is ON or in “remote” mode if required.
  * Not pre-cooling the condenser → this can cause pressure to spike and an overload alarm because the vapor has nowhere cold to go initially. Always cool the condenser ahead of vacuum application (either manually or by having a step in recipe that cools things before vacuum; some recipes include a “hold at -40C for 30 min with vacuum off” which effectively pre-cools the condenser as the compressor would be on to get shelf to -40).
  * Overfilling the condenser with ice (beyond capacity) → know the ice capacity (about 6 kg for this model). If you plan to remove more water than that, you either need to break the run into two (with defrost in between) or ensure a bigger condenser. Usually, your batch should not exceed that. If during a run you suspect too much ice (condenser temperature climbing toward 0°C), consider aborting and defrosting, or extend primary drying time at low shelf temp to sublimate slowly.
  * Improper stoppering technique → If your unit has an automatic stoppering function, make sure you use it correctly (we’ll detail in operations section). A user error here is venting fully to atmosphere *before* stoppering – which means the rubber stoppers might pop out rather than in. The correct approach is partial pressurization with inert gas then activate stoppering so that differential pressure pushes stoppers in.

In short, use the software’s features to help you: set those maintenance timers, use the graphs to watch the cycle, heed the alarms and log messages, and always verify settings. The interface, while complex at first glance, will become a trusted tool as you grow familiar with what each indicator and control means.

With a solid understanding of the interface, we can now move on to operating procedures – putting it all together for a real freeze-drying run.

## Freeze-Drying Operation: Complete Procedure (From Start to Finish)

In this section, we provide a step-by-step **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** for running a freeze-drying cycle on the Labfreez FD-10F-TP, specifically tailored to peptide API products in vials. This will integrate what we’ve covered (hardware setup, software navigation, recipe creation) into a coherent workflow. Follow these steps in order for a successful run:

**1. Preparation of Product and Loading Vials:**

* Prepare your peptide solution according to your formulation (with excipients as needed). Typically, you will have the solution sterile-filtered and dispensed into vials.
* **Filling vials:** Fill each vial to the desired volume (e.g., 2 mL solution in a 5 mL vial). Aim for consistency across all vials for uniform drying. Do not overfill; leave headspace because the frozen product will expand.
* **Partial stoppering:** Place lyophilization stoppers loosely on each vial – usually stoppers are designed to sit in the neck without fully sealing, allowing gas exchange. Ensure they are all at the same partially inserted height. This is crucial so that during drying vapor can escape, but later you can push them in to seal.
* Load the vials onto the freeze dryer shelf. For the stoppering model (FD-10F-TP has one shelf), arrange vials in a single layer, evenly spaced. Avoid crowding them too tightly; good airflow between vials is beneficial. If your batch doesn’t cover the whole shelf, group vials toward the center for even cooling (but not touching each other). The shelf can accommodate hundreds of vials (for example \~220 of 22 mm diameter vials), but do not exceed the shelf capacity or weight limit (check spec, e.g., total 1 L volume).
* If using multiple product types at once, avoid that for now – stick to one product per run to keep recipe consistent.
* Close the chamber door securely. Make sure the gasket makes full contact. Latch/lock the door per the equipment design (some have a clamp or toggle locks). A good seal is confirmed by slight resistance as the gasket compresses and by the vacuum holding later on.

**2. System Pre-check:**

* Verify that the condenser drain valve is closed tightly.
* Ensure the vacuum pump is connected and ready (power on, but you can leave it off – the software will start it).
* Check that the refrigeration system is at ambient (if it was recently used and still cold, that’s fine).
* Log in to the Lyo-Pilot software (Operator role). Confirm on the main screen that no alarms are active and that the system reads ambient conditions (shelf \~ room temp, vacuum \~ atm).
* Select or load the appropriate recipe for this product. Go to the Recipe Parameter screen and choose the recipe you prepared (by number or name). Quickly scroll through the steps to confirm all settings (especially vacuum start step, times, etc.). If any adjustments are needed, do so and hit Recipe Save. Ensure the recipe is now loaded (the main screen should show the recipe name/number).
* Recommended: Pre-cool the **condenser**. You have two options:

  1. **Automatic approach:** If your recipe’s first step is a freezing hold and vacuum doesn’t start until, say, step 3 or 4, the system *might* automatically start cooling the condenser when the recipe runs (particularly by the time vacuum is on, it definitely will). However, to be safe, it’s often advised to start the condenser in advance.
  2. **Manual approach:** Switch to Manual Operation quickly, turn on Compressor and Condenser Chill (in manual mode). Watch the condenser temp drop for about 15–20 minutes. You could aim for at least -40°C before proceeding. (During this time, the shelf is still at ambient or you could even start cooling shelf too; but maybe let product start freezing with recipe itself if that’s how you designed).
  3. Once pre-cooling is underway, you can actually start the recipe in parallel – many operators start the recipe’s freezing step while the condenser is still cooling, since freezing the product takes time and by the time vacuum is needed, the condenser is ready.
* So ensure **condenser is cooling** (manually or will be via recipe), and then you’re ready to begin the automated sequence.

**3. Start the Recipe (Auto Mode):**

* Make sure the system is in **Auto** mode (Manual Operation screen, Auto = ON, Manual = OFF).
* On the main screen or recipe screen, there should be a **Start** command. Some interfaces have a “Start” button on the main screen (perhaps appears when a recipe is loaded), others might use the Manual Operation screen’s start button if Auto is on. In our case, since Manual Start was labeled for manual mode, the actual method might be: go to main menu and select “Run” or simply press “Recipe A” or “Recipe B” if those were start triggers (though not clearly documented).
* If unsure, one reliable way: After loading the recipe, go to Manual Operation, ensure Auto is selected, then press **Manual Start**. If Auto is active, that might initiate the auto cycle (despite name). The system should then begin Step 1 of the loaded recipe. (Watch if Current Step on main screen goes to 1 and Running Time starts counting – that’s confirmation).
* Alternatively, some systems require pressing a physical **START** on the machine HMI. Check if the freeze dryer unit has a start button or if the software has a “play” icon, etc. Assuming pressing Manual Start with Auto on did the trick, proceed.
* Immediately, the software will start executing the recipe:

  * Step 1 (freezing): The shelf will begin to cool towards the setpoint (e.g., -45°C). You’ll see on the main screen the shelf SV show -45 and PV dropping. The compressor should be running (if not already from pre-cooling), and likely the Chamber Chill valve opens to cool the shelf. The condenser should also be cooling (if you pre-cooled manually, it’s already cold; if not, it would start now because the shelf cooling might engage the compressor – though in some sequences, they start condenser only when vacuum starts; it varies, but assume it’s cooling).
  * Allow the product to freeze as per the time set. You can watch the shelf temperature graph to ensure it reaches and holds -45°C. If you had a product probe, you’d see product temp eventually equilibrate near shelf temp (maybe a bit higher if exothermic crystallization happens).
  * If an annealing step is next, the system will raise the shelf to that temperature. Monitor that it happens slowly (if slope is active) – the shelf PV should track upward to, say, -20°C. The frozen product may warm slightly and potentially some crystallization occurs in it.
  * Then it will cool back down if you had another freeze step after annealing.
* **Vacuum initiation:** When the recipe hits the step designated as Vacuum Startup (say Step 4), the software will automatically **start the vacuum pump** and open the chamber isolation valve. Now the chamber pressure will begin to drop. Keep a close eye on the pressure reading and product behavior at this moment. Ideally, the product is well frozen (shelf is still at -45 or so). The pressure will fall from \~1000 Pa down to tens of Pa over a few minutes. This is when the condenser needs to be fully functional; ensure condenser temp is far below 0°C (preferably -50 or better). You may see a slight spike in pressure initially as the vacuum pulls and some warm air rushes out, but it should then steadily decline.

  * If within a few minutes the pressure does not drop below, say, 100 Pa, there might be a leak – abort and check seals as mentioned.
  * If you hear the vacuum pump’s tone change and it starts working hard, that’s normal when pressure gets low.
  * The recipe’s vacuum setpoint (if you set one, e.g., 20 Pa) will now come into play. The system will try to maintain that pressure. If the pump can go lower than 20 Pa, the controller will throttle it by bleeding a bit of air or using a proportional valve (if equipped) to hover around 20. If no active control (some units optionally have it), then the pump will just go as low as it can, and your “Vacuum Value” is more like a reference.
* **Primary Drying phase:** With vacuum on and shelf at a low set temp, sublimation begins. In our example, shelf might be at -20°C. Over the next several hours, ice in the product will sublimate. The condenser will accumulate this ice. Monitor:

  * **Shelf temperature**: The controller will try to keep it at -20°C (it might struggle if sublimation is intense, because sublimation causes cooling of product which can pull heat from shelf – the controller might inject more heat via heater to maintain -20). You might see the shelf PV oscillate a bit. As long as it’s within a couple degrees, all good.
  * **Product observation**: If you can see the vials through the door, check that there’s no melting or collapse. The product should remain as a solid cake gradually drying from top down. If you see liquid, either temperature is too high or vacuum lost (so stop if that’s happening).
  * **Chamber pressure**: Should be at or near setpoint (e.g., 20 Pa). If you notice pressure rising significantly above setpoint, possibly the condenser is overloaded (can’t trap vapor fast enough) or the vacuum pump is insufficient for the rate of sublimation (vapor choke scenario). An immediate response would be to lower the shelf temperature to slow down sublimation, giving the condenser a chance to catch up. The control system might do this automatically if Vacuum Heat Upper was set (e.g., if pressure >100 Pa, it might cut heat as we set).
  * **Condenser temperature**: It will likely rise from its no-load value (say -70°C) to a higher value (maybe -50, -40) as it accumulates ice. That’s normal. But if it comes close to 0°C or you see it not able to stay subzero, the ice load may be too high – consider aborting and defrosting, as a warm condenser won’t trap vapor, leading to vacuum loss.
  * Throughout primary drying, periodically check the **History Alarm** page to ensure no alarms (some systems log minor events too; mostly ensure no “Vacuum high” alarm, etc.).
  * The **Running Time** on main screen will show how long you’ve been in the step. Compare it to your recipe plan. Resist the urge to end primary drying early; a good indicator is product thermocouple if available – once the product temp starts rising to approach shelf temp (and pressure remains steady or starts dropping slightly because no more sublimation cooling), primary drying is essentially done. If no product probe, you rely on time safety margin; it’s better to err longer than to have undried ice.
* The recipe will automatically transition to the next steps (perhaps a slightly higher shelf temp to drive remaining moisture). It’s fine to observe that transition on the graphs.
* **Secondary Drying phase:** Now shelf might go to +20°C in our example. This will drive off residual water. Because there is no ice left, pressure might go even lower (if uncontrolled, the pump could pull down to its base, e.g. 5 Pa). If you set 10 Pa, it will maintain that. The product temperature will rise to near +20°C (since without ice cooling it, it can now heat up). This is expected. Typically secondary drying is much shorter than primary (hours vs tens of hours) but ensure you gave it enough time to reach desired residual moisture.

  * During this phase, watch for any signs of trouble like a sudden pressure spike (which could mean a vial broke and released its content – rare but watch).
  * Secondary drying often is safe and uneventful if primary was done well.
* **Cycle Completion:** At the end of the last step in your recipe, what happens depends on how you set it up. If the recipe simply ends at vacuum conditions, the system might just hold there or it might automatically stop controlling. Many systems at end of recipe will turn off heaters and just hold vacuum (and maybe compressor stays on to keep things cold if not instructed otherwise). Check the documentation: if the recipe ended and the machine does nothing further, at this point you need to manually proceed with stoppering and venting. Some sophisticated cycles include a final step like “Chamber backfill to 500 mbar with N2 and Stoppering” – but given our interface, we likely handle that manually.

  * You will know the recipe steps are complete when Current Step shows as 0 or the timer stops incrementing and maybe a message “Recipe Finished” appears. Often an alarm or buzzer sounds to indicate completion.

**4. Stoppering the Vials under Vacuum:**

* Ensure you are present at cycle completion (don’t let the chamber warm up or vent without control). The product is now fully dried but still under high vacuum and cold.
* If not already, switch to **Manual mode** (Manual Operation screen, Manual ON, Auto OFF) – this gives you direct control. Do **NOT** turn off the vacuum pump yet and do not turn off refrigeration until stoppering is done.
* The goal is to introduce inert gas up to a partial pressure so that we can stopper vials, then fully vent to atmosphere. The FD-10F-TP stoppering mechanism likely works by physically pushing the shelf up. There are a couple of possible designs: some use a hydraulic piston that you trigger (maybe a button or lever on the machine) which will push when pressure inside equals outside (i.e., after venting); others allow stoppering under slight vacuum to “pull” stoppers in.
* The typical method: introduce nitrogen gas until the chamber pressure rises to about 0.5 atm (for example, \~50,000 Pa). This creates a pressure differential between outside (atm) and inside that helps push stoppers in when the shelf moves up. Because outside pressure is higher, when you push the shelf, it will press the stoppers in tightly and they will stay due to outside pressure holding them.
* How to do this in practice: Locate the **vent valve or gas backfill valve**. It might be a toggle in the software or a manual valve. Often, one can simply crack open the valve connected to the nitrogen supply. In manual mode, do one of the following:

  * If there’s a “Vent” or “Air/N2” valve control in software, activate it to slowly admit gas. (The interface doesn’t explicitly show one, but maybe opening the “Vacuum Pump” off might automatically vent through a solenoid? Or you physically open a valve on the machine.)
  * If manual, slightly open the valve on the gas line. **Do this slowly** to avoid a rush of gas. You’ll see chamber pressure start rising on the vacuum gauge. Bring it up to roughly e.g. 50000–70000 Pa (0.5–0.7 atm) then close the valve. The chamber is now at partial vacuum.
* Now trigger the **stoppering mechanism**. Some systems do it automatically when you reach a certain pressure, others require pressing a button (maybe a “Stoppering” button or lever on the machine). If Labfreez provided instructions: possibly one needs to log in as “Vendor” or use a hardware switch to raise the shelf. Since our UI doesn’t show a stoppering control, it could be a physical action: sometimes, there’s a handwheel or an automated piston triggered by a “Stop” in the cycle. Check if the machine came with a hydraulic pump handle or an electric switch. Assuming it is automated, likely at the end of recipe the shelf jack is engaged (some freeze dryers have it integrated: they backfill to \~0.7 atm and then an internal pressure or spring pushes the shelf up – design dependent).
* Let’s assume a manual procedure: There might be a knob labeled “Stoppering” – turning it might raise the shelf. Or a separate control panel. If unsure, consult the Labfreez manual or ask a colleague who has used it. For safety here, we’ll assume it’s a manual lever: operate it to push the shelf upward. You’ll feel resistance as stoppers are inserted. Once fully inserted, lock it if needed, then release pressure. (If it’s automated, it might sense end of travel and stop.)
* With stoppers now seated, proceed to fully vent the chamber to atmospheric pressure. Open the gas valve further until Chamber VAC reading goes to \~100000 Pa (or 0 Pa if gauge saturates at atm). You might hear a gentle whoosh as final air comes in. Now the inside is atmospheric and vials are stoppered, isolating the product from the environment.
* Turn **off the vacuum pump** (you can hit Vacuum Pump OFF on manual screen, or power it down). It’s important to not run the pump at atmosphere for long as it can overheat or flood with air; once vented, immediately turn it off.
* Turn off the **compressor** if it’s still on (Compressor OFF, and Heater off as well). Essentially, stop all active systems now that the cycle is complete and stable.

**5. Unloading Product:**

* Open the chamber door carefully. There might be residual cold vapor or slight vacuum if not perfectly equalized, so open slowly. Ensure you have gloves on (the shelf and vials may still be below room temp).
* Inspect a couple of vials: the stoppers should be fully seated. The product cake should be intact, typically a chalky white or off-white puck at the bottom of the vial. If you see any collapse or melting (looks like liquid or glassy), something went wrong in process (maybe too high temp) – note it for investigation.
* Remove the vials from the shelf. Avoid disturbing the stoppers. If you plan to cap the vials (sealing aluminum caps on them), you can do that after they warm up a bit (to avoid condensation).
* Immediately store the vials with appropriate measures (if they need to be kept dry, put dessicant or seal them with flip-off caps soon, especially if in humid environment).
* If the product must be kept sterile, ensure you’re doing this in a cleanroom or with aseptic technique. Often, freeze dryers for injectable products are installed in clean environments and have sterilizable chambers. That’s beyond our scope, but just keep in mind to minimize exposure if sterility is needed.

**6. Post-Run Equipment Care (Defrost and Cleanup):**

* After removing product, you must **defrost the condenser** to remove the accumulated ice. Close the door (or leave it ajar if that’s recommended – though leaving it open will let moist air into chamber; usually better closed and vent valve open). Use the **Defrost** function: in Manual Operation, press Defrost ON. This will heat the condenser. You’ll see condenser temperature begin to rise above 0°C and water will start dripping into the drain container. Ensure the drain valve is open and the container is in place. It can take some time (maybe 30 min to an hour) to fully melt all ice, depending on volume.
* Monitor the water draining; empty the container if it fills (6 kg ice = 6 L water max, ensure container can handle that).
* Once ice is gone, turn Defrost OFF. The condenser may be warm (even heated to maybe +50°C during defrost to dry it out). Let it cool back down to room temperature gradually.
* **Drain and Clean:** When defrost is done, leave the drain valve open for a bit to let any residual water drip. Then close it. Wipe the chamber interior and shelf with a clean, lint-free cloth to remove any moisture. If product spilled or any powder is in chamber, use appropriate cleaning procedure (e.g., 70% IPA for biological materials, or just dry brush out powders, etc.). Clean the door gasket of any ice residue to maintain good sealing.
* If this was possibly the last run of the day, you can now **shut down** the software and equipment: log off the software, exit the program, and turn off the main power switch of the freeze dryer. However, if you plan to do another batch soon, you can keep it in standby (with refrigeration off, vacuum off).
* Remove the vacuum pump oil mist filter (if external exhaust) and check if any oil got pushed out – if yes, you might need to refill a bit. Generally, after a long run, the pump oil might absorb some moisture or volatiles. If it turned milky, you should change it. We’ll cover that in maintenance, but just note the pump’s health.

**7. Recording Data and Observations:**

* Save the run data: If the software allows, export the temperature/vacuum curves and logs to a USB drive (especially for internal records or troubleshooting). At minimum, note down the batch, recipe used, any alarms that occurred, and any observations about the product appearance.
* This documentation is important for validating the process for future runs and for compliance if this is GMP production.

By following the above procedure, you should achieve a successful lyophilization cycle. Over time, you’ll refine the recipe parameters based on results (e.g., if product has too high residual moisture, you may extend secondary drying, or if cycle is too long, you might safely shorten some holds if data shows completeness earlier). Always incorporate what you learn back into updating the recipes (and save new versions/names so you keep old ones too).

In the event something goes wrong mid-cycle (power failure, etc.), see troubleshooting section below for guidance. But the process described aims to minimize such issues.

## Troubleshooting Guide (Alarms, Errors, and Solutions)

Even with careful planning, issues can arise during freeze-drying. The FD-10F-TP, through its interface and hardware design, provides clues (alarms, logs, sensor readings) to diagnose problems. This troubleshooting guide covers common problems, likely causes, and suggested actions, focusing on what you can detect via the software’s diagnostics:

* **Problem: Vacuum will not reach the setpoint / chamber won’t evacuate.**
  **Symptoms:** After starting vacuum, the pressure remains high (e.g., above a few hundred Pa) and an alarm “Vacuum Low” or “Vacuum Fail” might trigger. The vacuum curve on screen is flat and high, and you might hear the pump running loudly with little effect.
  **Likely Causes:** A leak in the system or pump inefficiency. Common leak points are: the chamber door gasket (if not sealed or dirty), the drain valve (left open or not fully closed), the gas vent valve (perhaps slightly open or its O-ring dirty), or any connection on the vacuum line (loose hose clamp, etc.). Pump inefficiency could be due to low or contaminated oil, or a malfunctioning pump.
  **Troubleshooting Actions:**

  * **Pause the process:** If you’re early in the run (and product is still frozen), you can put the system in hold – close the isolation valve or stop the pump to break vacuum slowly, then address the issue. If product is not frozen, refreeze it first.
  * **Check obvious leaks:** Is the door properly latched? Open it and inspect the gasket for any frost, debris, or damage. Wipe it dry and clean, then re-close firmly. Ensure the drain valve is absolutely closed (turn it and maybe give it a gentle extra snug). Confirm the inert gas/vent valve is closed. Also check that any unused ports (like sensor ports) are capped.
  * **Vacuum pump oil:** Look at the pump’s oil sight glass. If the oil looks cloudy (milky) or very low, that’s a problem. Cloudy oil indicates water contamination, which drastically reduces vacuum performance. You may need to change the oil before re-attempting. Low oil means the pump might be sucking air through itself – top up with fresh oil to the proper level (do this with pump off and vented!).
  * **Pump function test:** You can test the pump by isolating it from the chamber: close the valve at the chamber (if there is one on the vacuum line) and see if the pump can pull down its own volume (some pumps have a blank-off test where you cap the inlet and see ultimate vacuum). If the pump still can’t pull low vacuum on itself, it’s likely an issue with the pump (worn seals, needs rebuild or oil change).
  * **Use the software log:** The History Alarm might show entries like “Vacuum \<target not reached in X minutes”. This just confirms the symptom, but not cause – physical inspection is key.
  * **After fixes:** Restart the vacuum and monitor. If pressure plummets now, you found the leak. If not, repeat checks or escalate to maintenance (there may be a crack or hidden leak). A trick: you can spray a little alcohol or use an ultrasonic leak detector around seals to find hissing.
  * **Preventive:** Always ensure vacuum tubing is firmly attached and all fittings are tight. Keep pump oil fresh.

* **Problem: Chamber pressure rises unexpectedly during primary drying (loss of vacuum control).**
  **Symptoms:** Vacuum had been stable but then jumps up (e.g., from 20 Pa to 200 Pa) and perhaps an alarm triggers. This could occur mid-cycle when heat is applied. The product might show signs of puffing (if you can see it).
  **Likely Causes:** **Condenser overload or vapor choke.** This means the rate of sublimation exceeded the capacity of the condenser or the flow path, causing pressure increase. Possibly too much heat was added too soon (product still had a lot of ice and shelf temp was raised aggressively), producing a large vapor influx. If the condenser’s coils are already coated with thick ice, their efficiency drops – they can’t catch all vapor, so pressure rises. Alternatively, **vacuum control valve issues** (if installed): maybe a malfunction caused it to close. Or, a sudden leak introduction (less likely if it correlates with heating event).
  **Troubleshooting Actions:**

  * **Immediately reduce shelf temperature:** via manual mode or recipe adjustment, drop the shelf setpoint to slow sublimation. This helps bring pressure down. If the system has Vacuum Heat cut-offs set, it might have already cut the heat – check if Heater indicator went off automatically (that’s the Vacuum Upper protection working).
  * **Check condenser temp:** Look at the condenser temperature reading. If it’s significantly warmer than earlier (e.g., it was -60°C, now it’s -30°C or rising), it’s struggling. The condenser might be near full of ice. If you estimate that the ice load is near its 6 kg limit, consider aborting the run and performing an intermediate defrost (this is not ideal for product, but losing vacuum control is worse). If some drying already occurred, you might be able to do a quick break, defrost, and resume (though product warms during that). It’s advanced to salvage a run like that; preferably, plan cycle within capacity.
  * **Vapor choke:** If the port between chamber and condenser is small, high sublimation rates can exceed flow capacity. The cure is similar: reduce sublimation rate (lower temp) and maybe slightly increase pressure setpoint (counter-intuitively, raising pressure a bit can reduce vapor generation rate because product won’t get as much heat – this is tricky though).
  * **After stabilization:** Once pressure is back in control, resume gentle drying. Possibly extend primary drying time since you had to slow it.
  * **Long-term solution:** If this happens often, your recipe is too aggressive or loads too large. Use slower shelf temp ramps, ensure pre-freezing is solid (so that product doesn’t foam), and maybe dry smaller batches or divide the process. Also check if the refrigerant system is fully functional (if condenser can’t hold temperature, maybe the refrigerant needs recharging or filters cleaning).

* **Problem: Product collapse or melt-back.**
  **Symptoms:** The dried cake in vials is not maintaining structure; it may have a melted appearance or large wet spots. You might notice this only after the cycle when inspecting vials, or in severe cases, see liquid during the process in some vials. Graphically, product temperature might have gone above a known threshold early.
  **Likely Causes:** **Shelf temperature too high** relative to product’s critical temperature, or vacuum too low (which raises product temperature due to less evaporative cooling). Essentially, the product wasn’t kept cold enough during primary drying and some or all of it melted. Another cause can be inadequate freezing (if product wasn’t fully frozen, then vacuum caused boil-over and collapse).
  **Troubleshooting Actions:**

  * There’s no fix *during* the run for collapse – once it’s collapsed, the elegant dry structure is lost. But you can prevent further damage: lower shelf temp immediately to re-freeze any melt. But that can also lock in a collapsed structure.
  * If caught early (like you saw liquid at vacuum start), you could stop the run, vent, refreeze properly, then restart (the batch might still be okay if re-frozen quickly).
  * **Analyze recipe vs product limits:** Check what you set for primary drying temperature. For many peptide formulations with amorphous stabilizers, collapse temperature (T\_c) might be around -20°C or -15°C. If you set -10°C, you likely went too high. Next time, use a lower shelf temp. Or if you notice product thermocouple spiked above 0°C, that’s a bad sign – keep it always below the known collapse temp.
  * Ensure **annealing** or proper freezing so that crystallizable components crystallize (increasing the eutectic point) and to avoid supercooling issues. Also, use the Eutectic Curve feature in an empty run with a sample to determine at what temperature your product collapses, then stay well below that in actual runs.
  * Unfortunately, collapsed product often means the batch is not usable (especially for pharmaceuticals, it may fail potency or reconstitution tests). Focus on adjusting the process to prevent recurrence.

* **Problem: Vials break or crack during the cycle.**
  **Symptoms:** You find one or more vials with cracks, or bottoms popped off, either at the end or you hear a “ping” during the run. The vacuum might show a slight spike if a vial broke open under vacuum (letting air from that vial out). You might see powder spilled in the shelf.
  **Likely Causes:** **Thermal stress or overpressure in vials.** Rapid freezing or heating can cause glass stress, especially if fill volume was large. If a vial is overfilled and frozen, expansion can crack it. Also, stoppering can crack vials if misaligned or if the shelf pushed too fast at a slight angle.
  **Troubleshooting Actions:**

  * Once a vial is broken, not much to do for that vial except discard later. If multiple vials cracked, consider aborting because product may be exposed (if stoppers came off) – contamination risk. If it’s minor and contained, you can often finish the run for the rest.
  * Use the Operation Log to see if any unusual operations happened at those times (maybe an abrupt temperature change). Check if your freezing rate was extremely fast (shelf cooling at maximum). Sometimes ramping a bit slower can reduce thermal shock to glass.
  * **Check stopper positioning:** Mis-set stoppers can cause uneven force during stoppering, cracking necks. Ensure uniform stopper placement next time and that the shelf is level when pushing.
  * If breakage happened at vacuum release, maybe you vented too fast – rapid pressurization can pop stoppers or crack vials. Always vent slowly.
  * For future, if using larger fill volumes, consider vials with thicker walls or use two-step freezing (cool to -20 then -40 rather than straight to -40). Also verify vial quality (sometimes a batch of vials has microscopic weaknesses).

* **Problem: Incomplete drying (high residual moisture in product).**
  **Symptoms:** Upon visual inspection, the cake might look shrinked or not fully dry, or upon reconstitution it’s cloudy (indicating some collapse or not fully dried). If you have a moisture analyzer or weigh the vials, they might be heavier than expected (water remaining). There may not have been any clear alarm for this – it’s usually noticed after the cycle.
  **Likely Causes:** **Insufficient primary or secondary drying time**, or too low shelf temp in primary (so drying took much longer than given). Possibly the cycle ended prematurely (user error in recipe step durations). Also, if vacuum was lost at times, drying could have stalled.
  **Troubleshooting Actions:**

  * If you catch it immediately after cycle (stoppers not sealed yet), you could theoretically re-start vacuum and put it back for additional drying time (kind of re-running the secondary dry). However, once you vented and stoppered, it’s not possible to dry further without reprocessing.
  * Check the recipe: Did you allow enough time for primary drying? As a rule, primary drying often takes 6–10 times longer than it takes to just sublimate the ice if you calculated, because of safety margins. If in doubt, extend next time. It’s better to overdry a bit than to have residual moisture.
  * Check shelf temperature during primary: if it was very low (like -40°C the whole time to be safe), maybe it was so slow that not all water escaped in allotted time. You might ironically need to raise shelf temp a bit (within safe range) to drive faster drying. It’s a balance.
  * Secondary drying: Ensure you reached a sufficiently high temperature and held long enough to get moisture down to desired level (1–2% typically). Proteins/peptides often tolerate up to +30°C in dry state; if you only went to +20 for short time, maybe bump to +25 and extend a couple hours.
  * If you had a product thermocouple and it never plateaued, that’s a clear sign primary wasn’t done. Or if the vacuum curve showed continuing outgassing (pressure remaining higher than base), not done. Use those signals next time to judge end-point (there are also methods like comparative pressure measurement if equipped, but not sure if this unit has that).
  * It’s safer in subsequent runs to err on longer drying. Document the findings and adjust the SOP.

* **Problem: Freeze dryer software locks up or PLC communication lost.**
  **Symptoms:** The interface becomes unresponsive, or you get a “Communication Error” that doesn’t clear. The timers stop updating. However, the machine might still be running in the background (because the PLC might continue the recipe). This is more of a technical glitch than process issue.
  **Likely Causes:** Computer or software crash, network cable disconnect, or USB dongle issue if used. Could be due to Windows updates, etc.
  **Troubleshooting Actions:**

  * **Do not panic**: The cycle is likely still ongoing inside the machine. If you suspect it’s still running (you hear compressor, etc.), do not immediately power off the machine as that would definitely stop the cycle abruptly.
  * Try to restore communication: If it’s an external PC, check the cable connection to the unit. If loose, plug it back. Try restarting the Lyo-Pilot software (you may have to force close if it’s frozen, then reopen and log in; it might automatically reconnect to PLC and pick up current status).
  * If the software can’t reconnect, as a last resort you might have to stop the cycle manually: to do so without software, you’d have to press emergency stop or kill power. But before that, maybe wait and see if the cycle finishes as per programmed time (if you know it was near end). Many PLCs will run the recipe to completion even if UI is gone. Once you think it’s done, you can safely break vacuum and recover the product. Then reboot everything.
  * After such event, check the Operation Log when back up to see what happened at crash time (there might not be info if software froze, but maybe an error code). Involve IT if it’s a recurring problem. Keep the PC healthy (no other heavy programs that could interfere, etc.).

* **Problem: Strange readings (sensor error or out-of-range).**
  **Symptoms:** The shelf temperature reading is obviously incorrect (e.g., showing +200°C or -999°C), or vacuum reading is stuck at 0.0 Pa always, etc. Possibly an alarm “Temp Sensor Failure” or similar appears.
  **Likely Causes:** Faulty sensor (broken thermocouple or RTD), cable disconnection, or need recalibration. If a sensor calibration is way off, it might not throw an error but readings will be wrong.
  **Troubleshooting Actions:**

  * Identify which sensor: If shelf temp reads nonsense, perhaps the shelf probe is disconnected. Check the wiring – maybe when loading samples a cable got yanked. Many shelf sensors are plugged in via connectors; ensure it’s plugged.
  * If vacuum sensor always reads 0.0 Pa even at atmosphere, it might be failed or its cable loose. Some Pirani gauges have to be zeroed; maybe it’s mis-zeroed. Try seeing if it changes at all when vacuum applied. If not, likely dead.
  * In the short term, you can still run the dryer if, say, one temp sensor fails – often there’s an internal safety to prevent overheating if sensor lost. You might rely on other readings or external thermometers until fixed. However, it’s best to abort the run if a critical sensor fails (especially vacuum sensor; you can’t control what you can’t measure).
  * Use the **Parameters** login and sensor calibration function only if you have a reference and know what you’re doing. For example, to calibrate shelf temp, compare it with a calibrated thermometer at a known point (0°C ice bath or something). Then enter an offset. Similarly for vacuum: some systems let you adjust gauge reading to match a standard gauge. Usually, yearly calibration by a technician is recommended.
  * If an alarm is persistent (like “shelf sensor error”), you may have to replace that sensor. That’s maintenance team’s job typically.
  * Meanwhile, you could use a workaround: for instance, if shelf sensor is gone but product sensor works, you could run in manual mode controlling by that – but that’s advanced and not recommended for novices. Safer to postpone run until fixed if key sensors are offline.

**Using the Logs and Alarms effectively:** Always review the **History Alarm** after a cycle if any anomaly happened. It provides timestamps that you can correlate with the recipe step. For example, “2025-05-01 14:23:45 – Alarm: Shelf Temp Deviation High” could tell you that perhaps at step 5 when you ramped, the shelf couldn’t keep up (maybe indicating a refrigeration issue). The **Operation Log** will show things like “Vacuum Pump ON” at certain times, “Recipe Step advanced” etc., which can help reconstruct events if you weren’t watching live.

**When to involve maintenance or stop using the machine:** If you encounter serious issues like **persistent vacuum leaks** you cannot fix, **compressor not cooling at all** (e.g., shelf and condenser never go below 0°C – indicates refrigeration failure), **vacuum pump smoking or very loud** (could indicate pump failure or need for rebuild), electrical burning smell, etc., it’s time to halt operation and get professional service. The user manual can only guide so far; don’t risk product or safety if something fundamental is wrong. The FD-10F-TP has alarm and diagnostic features meant to aid troubleshooting, but some repairs require a qualified technician (for example, changing a vacuum pump belt or compressor recharge).

To summarize, troubleshooting involves a combination of **software diagnostics** (alarms, graphs, logs) and **hands-on inspection**. Always maintain a calm approach: secure the product (keeping it cold if possible), then address the equipment issue methodically. Many issues are preventable with good maintenance, which leads us to the next section.

## Maintenance and Calibration Schedule

Regular maintenance of the freeze dryer and its components is crucial for reliable operation and longevity of the equipment. The FD-10F-TP provides software reminders for certain tasks (as we saw in System Parameters), but it’s ultimately up to the operators to perform the maintenance. Below is a recommended maintenance schedule and procedures for both the hardware and software aspects:

**Daily (After Each Run) Maintenance:**

* **Condenser Defrost and Cleaning:** After every drying run, fully defrost the condenser (as described in the operation section). Don’t leave the ice sitting after you’re done – if it refreezes or stays, it can lead to corrosion or mold. Once melted, drain the water and wipe the chamber dry. If your product has an odor or could cross-contaminate, consider rinsing the condenser with warm water (with power off!) and then drying it. Always return the system to a dry state for storage.
* **Chamber Cleaning:** Remove any product residues from the shelf and chamber. Use a soft cloth. For peptides/pharmaceuticals, it’s good to wipe surfaces with 70% isopropanol or ethanol to maintain cleanliness (ensuring no reactive residue). Make sure no lint is left on gasket or shelf.
* **Gasket Care:** Inspect the door gasket for frost or indentations. Wipe it with a damp cloth to remove any product powder or ice, then dry it. A thin layer of vacuum grease can be applied periodically (maybe weekly or as needed) to keep it supple – but don’t overdo it (excess grease can actually attract dust). The aim is to keep the gasket conditioned so it doesn’t crack. If you see any cracks or flattening, plan to replace it (and in meantime, leaks may occur).
* **Vacuum Pump Check:** After each run, observe the vacuum pump while it’s running and after. If you notice any smoke or mist from it, ensure the mist filter is functioning (clean/replace the filter element as needed, typically after some dozens of hours). Check oil level: If it dropped notably or looks milky, it may need attention before next run. HarvestRight (home dryer) guidance suggests filtering or changing oil every 5 runs or so for their pumps, but in a lab/pharma setting, you should at least visually inspect oil each run. If oil is only slightly cloudy, you might run one more cycle, but plan to change soon.
* **Data Backup:** It’s wise to periodically back up your recipe configurations to a safe location (if the software allows exporting recipes or if you can copy the config files). This isn’t daily, but after any changes. Also save any run logs you need for records.

**Weekly Maintenance:**

* **Vacuum Pump Oil Change:** Depending on usage intensity. A conservative schedule is to change oil every 100 hours of pump operation or monthly, whichever comes first (for heavy use, that could be weekly!). The System Parameters allows you to track Normal Oil Change hours. If the pump has been exposed to acids or solvents, change oil more frequently. To change oil: follow pump manual – typically, run pump for 10 minutes to warm oil (under gas ballast open to purge moisture if it has that feature), then turn off and drain oil via the drain plug into an appropriate waste container. Dispose as per regulations (it’s contaminated oil). Refill with fresh vacuum pump oil to correct level. Use only recommended grades. If an **Initial Oil Change** was set (say at 25 Hr for a new pump), be sure to do that initial change – new pumps shed some debris initially. The interface will remind you (red indicator) when the hour count is hit【20†】; after changing, reset the timer via System Para screen (press Start under Normal Oil to start counting for next interval).

* **General Inspection:** Once a week, do a quick walk-around:

  * Check all cables and connections (signal cables for sensors, communication cables) for wear or looseness.
  * Listen for any unusual sounds from compressor or pump (changes could indicate developing issues).
  * Check that the condensation from the last run didn’t leak anywhere it shouldn’t (no puddles under machine).
  * If you have an oil-backup (oil catch) or vacuum trap, empty/clean it.
  * Verify the fan vents are not clogged (especially if lab is dusty).

**Monthly Maintenance:**

* **Condenser Fan and Coil Cleaning:** Dust can accumulate on the condenser’s radiator fins and the fan blades. Power down and unplug the dryer. Remove any access panel to the condenser area (if user-serviceable – otherwise, ask maintenance). Use a soft brush or vacuum cleaner to gently remove dust from the fins of the heat exchanger and the fan. If the software’s “Condenser Fan Clean” timer was set for monthly or quarterly, follow that. You can log the date when cleaned and reset the reminder in System Para (set new Act date)【20†】. Keeping these clean ensures proper airflow and cooling efficiency.
* **Calibration Check:** Every few months (or if you suspect drift), verify the temperature and vacuum readings:

  * Place a calibrated thermometer on the shelf and set shelf to, say, 0°C. See if the Lyo-Pilot reading matches within a small tolerance. Also check at a higher point like 25°C and a low like -40°C (if you have calibration equipment). If deviations are significant (>2°C), you may use the calibration function to adjust offset or call a service engineer.
  * For vacuum, if you have an external gauge (like a McLeod gauge or another reliable sensor), compare readings at a certain vacuum level. Pirani gauges often are less accurate in mid-range; but ensure at least that when you vent, the reading goes to atmospheric (which on some gauges might read as 1000 Pa or show as 0 if out of range – you may calibrate the zero if needed). The vacuum transducer might also need annual calibration by professionals.
* **Door Alignment and Stoppering Mechanism:** Check that door hinges or latches are tight. If you have a manual stoppering jack, lubricate it lightly as per manual (maybe with a little grease on threads or cylinder). Cycle it (with chamber empty at atm) to keep it from sticking.
* **Software Updates and Battery:** If the control system uses a battery-backed memory (for PLC), ensure battery is within date (some hardware have 5-year lithium battery for memory/clock; replace if needed per manufacturer). Also check if any software updates from Labfreez exist that address bugs – apply with caution and normally not unless recommended, since a stable validated system is preferred.

**Quarterly/Semi-Annual Maintenance:**

* **Deep Cleaning:** Schedule a thorough cleaning. This might involve partial disassembly like removing the shelf to clean beneath, cleaning sensors, etc. Sterilize chamber if used for sterile products (some freeze dryers allow steam/CIP or you might use chemical sanitants – follow appropriate SOP for cleaning).
* **Lubrication:** Some moving parts (door latch, hinges, any valves) may need a drop of machine oil or grease. Do NOT grease inside vacuum valves or anything that contacts product – only the mechanical pivot points if sticky. The vacuum pump motor might have service ports for oiling bearings if it’s older type (most are sealed nowadays).
* **Vacuum Pump Rebuild (as needed):** After maybe 6 months to a year of heavy use, consider replacing pump seals and filtering the oil more frequently or switching to an oil-less pump if maintenance is too burdensome (if budget allows).
* **Filter Replacements:** If the unit has any inline filters (some dryers have inlet filters on gas lines, or an oil mist filter on pump exhaust), change or clean them about twice a year.
* **Gasket Replacement:** The door gasket may need replacement every couple of years or sooner if it’s no longer sealing well. Keep a spare on hand. Replacing it is usually simple (pull out old, clean groove, insert new). After replacement, do a vacuum leak test to ensure it’s sealing properly.

**Yearly Professional Service:**

* Consider having the unit professionally inspected and calibrated annually. They can check the compressor’s refrigerant level (if cooling performance degraded, might need a top-up or leak fix), vacuum pump deeper maintenance (like checking vanes), and electrical components (contactors, etc.). Also verifying the temperature and vacuum calibrations to certified standards (important if your lab is under regulatory compliance).

**Software Integrated Checks Recap:**

* Use the **System Parameter maintenance reminders** as a guide but not the only thing. For example, if you set Vacuum Normal Oil Change to 100 Hr【20†】, the red light will come on roughly at that usage. Don’t ignore it – schedule the oil change promptly. After changing, input 0 and Start to reset the counter.
* For **Condenser Fan Clean**, if you schedule it every 180 days, the reminder will help you not forget. When it triggers, perform the cleaning and then update the date fields for the next due date.
* Document each maintenance action in a logbook (date, what was done, who did it). This is good practice and required in regulated environments.

**Operational Maintenance Tips:**

* Always run the freeze dryer within specified limits: don’t exceed shelf temperature max (+65°C) or the condenser temp rating, etc. Running it at extremes constantly can shorten its life (e.g., heaters at full power all the time).
* After a long shutdown (if the dryer wasn’t used for a while), do a test run with no product: check vacuum performance and refrigeration before risking a product batch. Pumps especially can seize or oil can absorb moisture when idle – you might need to do an oil change if it sat for months.
* Keep spare parts handy: vacuum pump oil, gaskets, o-rings for valves, maybe a spare vacuum sensor and shelf temperature sensor. This way a failed minor part doesn’t cause extended downtime waiting for parts.
* The system likely has **alarm for “Vacuum pump maintenance due”** or similar if you set those timers. Do not override or disable these – they are there to protect the equipment. If you get frequent maintenance alarms, it’s indicating heavy usage – adjust maintenance frequency accordingly rather than ignoring alarms.

By adhering to this maintenance schedule and keeping the software’s maintenance logs up to date, you will ensure that the Labfreez FD-10F-TP operates smoothly and provides consistent, repeatable results. Well-maintained equipment not only prevents downtime but also contributes to the quality of your lyophilized products (e.g., a well-performing vacuum pump ensures low residual moisture; a clean condenser prevents contamination). Remember the adage: *an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure*. This is very true in lyophilization operations.

## Appendices

### A. Glossary of Terms

*This glossary defines key terms and abbreviations used in lyophilization and in the FD-10F-TP’s software interface:*

* **Lyophilization / Freeze Drying:** These terms are interchangeable, meaning the process of removing water from a frozen product via sublimation under vacuum.

* **Sublimation:** The direct transition of a substance from solid to gas phase without passing through liquid. In freeze drying, ice sublimates into water vapor under low pressure and mild heat.

* **Primary Drying:** The phase of lyophilization where frozen water (ice) is removed by sublimation. Conducted under deep vacuum and at temperatures below the product’s critical temperature. Removes the bulk (\~95%) of water.

* **Secondary Drying:** The phase after primary drying that removes water that is adsorbed or bound to the material. This is done at higher shelf temperatures (product is already mostly dry) to drive moisture content down to final levels (typically 1-5% residual).

* **Annealing:** In freeze drying, an optional step where the product is held at a higher sub-freezing temperature after initial freezing. Purpose is to improve crystallinity (form larger ice crystals, or crystallize excipients) which can speed drying. For example, freezing at -50°C, then annealing at -20°C for a few hours, then back to -50°C.

* **Eutectic Temperature (Eutectic Point):** The highest temperature at which a crystalline mixture can exist in solid form in equilibrium with its liquid phase. In context, some formulations freeze into crystalline solids that melt at a specific eutectic temp. Drying must occur below this temperature. Not all products have a eutectic point (those that form amorphous solids do not).

* **Glass Transition (Tg′):** The glass transition temperature of a maximally freeze-concentrated solution. For amorphous materials, this is effectively the “collapse temperature” threshold. Above Tg′, the frozen matrix softens (viscous liquid), risking collapse. Drying must be below Tg′ for amorphous systems.

* **Critical Temperature / Collapse Temperature:** A general term referring to the highest product temperature that will not cause loss of structure during freeze drying. Above this, the product either melts (for crystalline, at eutectic) or collapses (for amorphous, above Tg′). Often in pharma, we identify this via lab tests and ensure shelf temperature stays below this by a safety margin.

* **Collapse:** The structural failure of a partially dried amorphous product when its temperature goes too high during primary drying. It results in a melted-looking cake, often leading to high residual moisture and reduced stability.

* **Vacuum (Chamber Pressure):** In this context, “vacuum” is measured as absolute pressure inside the drying chamber, typically in **Pascals (Pa)** on this machine. 1 atm = 101,325 Pa = 760 torr = 1013 mbar. We often run freeze drying at pressures like 20–100 Pa (which is 0.2–1.0 mbar, or 0.15–0.75 torr). Lower pressure means deeper vacuum. The FD-10F-TP can go to <5 Pa ultimate.

* **Pascal (Pa):** The SI unit of pressure. 1 Pa is a very small pressure (approx 0.0075 torr). For reference: 133.3 Pa = 1 torr (mmHg). So 1000 Pa ≈ 7.5 torr. In freeze drying, pressures are often given in torr or mTorr in literature; here the interface uses Pa. (E.g., 0.1 mbar = 0.075 torr = 10 Pa). Understanding this helps set vacuum values appropriately.

* **Pirani Gauge:** A type of thermal conductivity vacuum sensor likely used to measure chamber pressure in the 0–1000 Pa range. It’s sensitive to low pressure but not accurate at atmosphere (which is why at atmosphere it might just read max or 0 if off-scale). It provides the “Chamber VAC” reading.

* **Condenser (Cold Trap):** The part of the freeze dryer that is cooled (often to -50 to -80°C) to capture water vapor as ice. It “condenses” the vapor coming from the product, hence protecting the vacuum pump from moisture. In FD-10F-TP, the condenser is internal and can hold \~6 kg of ice in 24h.

* **Shelf (Drying Shelf):** The platform inside the chamber on which product vials sit. It is temperature-controlled (cooling via refrigerant/oil and heating via heater). In stoppering units, it also can move up/down for vial stoppering.

* **Shelf Temperature (Shelf Temp, Tem. Value in interface):** The setpoint or actual temperature of the shelf. It’s what we control to indirectly control product temperature. The shelf can be cooled as low as -70°C (silicone oil models) or heated to +65°C (within spec).

* **Product Temperature (Product Temp):** Temperature of the product itself, typically measured by a thermocouple placed in a sample vial (if used). The interface has a channel for “Product Temp” plotting. It lags behind shelf temp and is crucial for determining if product has warmed (signifying end of drying) or if it’s staying at ice temperature.

* **PV / SV:** **Process Value** and **Set Value**. PV is the current measured value (e.g., actual temperature or pressure). SV is the target setpoint the system is trying to reach. For instance, Shelf PV might be -22.5°C while Shelf SV is -20°C, meaning it’s in the process of heating up to the setpoint.

* **Recipe:** A programmed sequence of steps (time, temperature, vacuum) for a freeze drying cycle. Stored in the control system memory (32 slots available on this system). Each recipe can have up to 50 steps as we saw. Sometimes called a “lyophilization cycle” or “program”.

* **Vacuum Startup Step:** A setting in this system specifying which step number should activate the vacuum pump. All steps before that are assumed to be at atmospheric pressure (vented). This is unique to programming in this control and prevents vacuum from engaging too early.

* **Slope Temp (setting):** In manual mode, an option to apply a ramp to temperature changes. Likely ensures a gradual change rather than an instantaneous jump to new setpoint, to avoid thermal shock.

* **Defrost (function):** A mode that heats the condenser to melt collected ice after a drying run. On this machine, probably an electric heater around the coil or using hot gas from compressor to warm it. Either way, it expedites turning ice to water for draining.

* **Inert Gas Backfill:** The process of introducing a dry, inert gas (like Nitrogen) into the chamber at the end of cycle to break vacuum. “Inert” means it won’t react with the product (and is usually sterile filtered for injectables). It also prevents moist room air from entering which could rehydrate the product. Often used in final stoppering.

* **Stoppering:** The act of sealing vials by pressing the rubber stoppers in under vacuum or partial vacuum. Stoppering mechanism is typically a movable shelf or platen that pushes vials up against a stationary upper plate, securing the stoppers in the vial mouths. In partial vacuum, stoppers may also get an assist from pressure as described.

* **GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice):** Not a software term, but mentioned in spec. It implies the equipment can meet pharmaceutical quality standards (e.g., documentation, control, ability to validate runs, etc.). As an internal manual, just be aware of compliance aspects: e.g., user access control (multiple user roles) is a GMP feature to track who did what.

* **Alarm:** A notification by the system when something is outside normal range or a fault occurs. Could be minor (warning) or major (cycle-stopping). Examples: temperature deviation alarm, vacuum high alarm, power fail alarm.

* **History Log / Event Log:** Record within the software of past alarms and operations. Useful for troubleshooting and audit trail.

* **CIP / SIP:** Cleaning-In-Place / Sterilization-In-Place. Not a focus here, but if the system were equipped, CIP means an automated system to clean internal chamber, SIP to sterilize it (usually via steam). Our interface didn’t explicitly cover CIP, likely not a feature on this pilot unit, but just to decode the acronyms if they appear.

* **Vapor Pressure:** In context, sometimes mentioned as the pressure at which water will sublimate at a given temperature. But not directly in our UI; related concept: colder shelf = lower vapor pressure of ice = slower sublimation.

By referring to this glossary, new users can quickly look up unfamiliar terms encountered in the manual or on the interface. Understanding these fundamentals will make operating the freeze dryer and interpreting results much easier.

### B. Quick Reference Guides

This section provides condensed checklists and tables for quick reference during operation. Experienced users can use these to jog their memory, and new users can use them as an on-hand cheat sheet alongside the detailed manual.

**Typical Parameter Ranges and Conversions:**

* Freezing shelf temp: **-40°C to -50°C** (common for many products). Some sensitive products might freeze at -30, others as low as -80 if special.
* Primary drying shelf temp: **-30°C to -10°C** (depending on product’s collapse temp). Crystalline (eutectic) products can go closer to 0°C, amorphous often need -20°C or lower initially.
* Secondary drying shelf temp: **+20°C to +30°C** (sometimes up to +40°C if product stable and low residual needed).
* Chamber pressure during primary: **\~20 to 200 Pa** (0.15 to 1.5 torr, or 0.2 to 2.0 mbar). Lower pressure (around 20-50 Pa) is typical for delicate products; some cycles use slightly higher pressure to control heat flow.
* Chamber pressure during secondary: often as low as the pump can go (to maximize desorption), e.g., **<10 Pa**.
* Conversion: 1 torr = 133.3 Pa. 1 mbar = 100 Pa. So:

  * 50 Pa ≈ 0.375 torr ≈ 0.5 mbar.
  * 200 Pa ≈ 1.5 torr ≈ 2.0 mbar.
  * 5 Pa (ultimate) = 0.0375 torr.
* **Shelf capacity:** FD-10F-TP normal model \~2 L total, stoppering \~1 L total. Don’t exceed these solution volumes to avoid overload (ice capacity 6 kg means \~6 L water max).
* **Time guidelines:** Freezing typically 1–3 hours (depending on volume and whether in-chamber). Primary drying can be 5–20 hours (depends on load and temp). Secondary 2–8 hours. Total cycle often 1–2 days for many pharma products. Always ensure primary isn’t shorter than what it takes for deepest vial to dry (use thermocouple data or err high).
* **Ramp rates:** If manually controlling slope, \~0.5–1°C per minute is gentle. The system likely does this when Slope Temp = Yes.
* **Stoppering pressure:** Partial vacuum \~0.2–0.5 atm inside chamber is a common range to stopper (so filling to \~20,000–50,000 Pa with N2).

**Common Do’s and Don’ts:**

* **Do** ensure samples are fully frozen (at or below their freezing point) *before* applying vacuum.
* **Do** pre-cool the condenser to at least -40°C before primary drying.
* **Do** keep an eye on the first sign of product temperature rise – indicates drying progress or problems.
* **Do** use inert gas for venting if product is oxygen-sensitive or to keep things dry.
* **Do** drain pump oil if it looks milky; running with bad oil can ruin the pump.
* **Don’t** open the chamber door when the system is under vacuum! (Serious safety hazard and product will blow out.)
* **Don’t** leave the freeze dryer unattended on its first few runs until you gain confidence it runs without issues. Monitor those graphs.
* **Don’t** set shelf temps above +65°C or below equipment’s spec (-70°C) in recipes – you could trigger safety cutoffs or simply not achieve it.
* **Don’t** ignore strange noises (scraping, knocking) – investigate promptly (e.g., ice could be hitting a fan, or a component might be failing).
* **Don’t** stopper vials at full atmosphere – you won’t get a tight seal. Always do under partial vacuum or at least with slight positive pressure after vacuum break (as per procedure).

This quick reference should help operators execute routine tasks without flipping through the entire manual. For any uncertainty, refer back to the detailed sections of the manual for explanation.

### C. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: How do I determine the proper shelf temperature for primary drying of my new peptide formulation?**
**A:** You need to find the product’s critical temperature (collapse or eutectic). This can be done by literature data on similar formulations, or by experimental methods like differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or a trial freeze-dry with a thermocouple in the product. Alternatively, use the freeze dryer’s **Eutectic Curve** feature: place a sample with a thermocouple, have the system slowly ramp the shelf temperature under vacuum, and watch when the product temperature spikes or structure collapses (often indicated by a sudden jump in thermocouple reading as ice melts). Suppose you find the collapse occurs at -15°C; then set your primary drying shelf temperature a safety margin below that, maybe -20°C. If uncertain, err lower initially (it only affects drying time, not product quality, whereas too high can ruin product). You can always try a slightly higher temp in the next run if the product cake was stable, to shorten drying time.

**Q2: The recipe I ran had 10 hours of primary drying, but I’m not sure if everything was dry. How can I confirm dryness before ending the cycle?**
**A:** The best in-process indicator is a **product thermocouple** in a representative vial: during primary drying, that thermocouple will read well below shelf temp (because of cooling from sublimation). Once all ice is gone in that vial, its temperature will rise and essentially meet the shelf temperature (because no more cooling effect). That is a strong sign primary drying is complete (for that vial at least). Additionally, observe the vacuum pressure: in some processes, when dryness is reached, the chamber pressure might actually drop closer to the base vacuum because there’s no outgassing vapor (if you see a sudden ability to reach lower pressure, that indicates end of sublimation). If you don’t have a thermocouple, you can extend the primary drying time with a margin (e.g., if calculations say 6 hours needed, run 9 hours). Another technique is the **pressure rise test**: isolate the chamber by closing a valve to the pump (if available) for a short period during drying and see how much pressure rises – a small rise indicates little ice left, a big jump means more ice sublimation still happening. This dryer may not have an automated way to do that, but you could simulate by turning off vacuum briefly (not recommended without a proper method). If unsure, always go longer or use secondary drying to catch remaining moisture. Post-process, you can test a couple vials for moisture content (e.g., by Karl Fischer titration) to validate your cycle.

**Q3: The interface’s vacuum reading shows 0.0 Pa even when I know it’s not high vacuum. Is the gauge broken?**
**A:** Likely not broken – it’s a matter of sensor range. The vacuum sensor (Pirani) might only measure up to 1000 Pa maximum. At atmospheric pressure (\~100,000 Pa), it’s way out of range and might default to a reading like 0 or some max value. So 0.0 Pa on the screen when the chamber is open or just starting pump usually means “pressure above sensor range” (i.e., no vacuum). Once you start vacuum and get below 1000 Pa, you’ll see it update and drop. If you *never* see it change from 0.0 even when clearly vacuum is on (and freeze drying proceeds), then there could be an issue with the sensor or its connection. But in normal cases, treat 0.0 reading at idle as just a quirk – the numeric display doesn’t show atmospheric pressure. You can verify by looking at the vacuum curve graph; at the far right, the scale goes to 1000 Pa and might show a flat line at the top initially【19†】, then when pumping it will come down into range. So the gauge isn’t linear beyond a certain point. If concerned, test it: pull a moderate vacuum and see if a value appears (say at least 500 Pa). If nothing, then yes maybe sensor is faulty.

**Q4: I’ve set Vacuum Heat Upper/Lower. Do I need to adjust these for each recipe?**
**A:** Not necessarily each recipe, but they should be set appropriate to your general process range. For example, you might set Vacuum Heat Lower = 20 Pa and Upper = 100 Pa as a global safe range. That means if pressure goes above 100 Pa (0.75 torr), the heaters will cut off to avoid product boiling; and they will only resume when pressure falls below 20 Pa, ensuring good vacuum before heating. These values can remain the same for most recipes as they’re protective limits. If you run a recipe intentionally at higher pressure (say 300 Pa for some reason), then you’d need to adjust or disable this feature as it would constantly keep heat off thinking vacuum is not good. For typical low-pressure cycles, leaving these values is fine. If you find the heaters turning off frequently (you’ll notice shelf temperature dropping unexpectedly and maybe messages in alarm log about vacuum heat), that’s a hint your process is pushing vacuum too high or these limits might be a tad too conservative. But generally, set once as per the type of products and forget. Always keep Vacuum Heat Upper below the pressure at which ice would start boiling at your shelf temp (you can reference phase diagrams of water, but e.g., water at 0°C has vapor pressure \~610 Pa, so definitely keep far below that – 100 Pa is a safe choice).

**Q5: The run completed, but I found the final product has a yellowish color whereas it was clear solution before. Did the freeze dryer cause this?**
**A:** A color change could indicate slight product degradation. Lyophilization is generally gentle, but some sensitive peptides or components might degrade if exposed to higher temperature or if the process was too long. A yellow or tan hue might mean Maillard reaction (if sugar and peptide, but that needs some heat), or oxidation. Check if during secondary drying the temperature got high. Also consider if the inert gas used was truly inert (was it pure nitrogen? Any chance oxygen got in?). Another angle: was the product initially at a different pH after reconstitution? Sometimes a pH shift during freeze concentration can cause changes (not necessarily dryer’s fault, but formulation). The dryer itself, if clean, doesn’t impart color. However, if vacuum pump oil backstreamed (unlikely at these pressures with a trap), that could contaminate – but that usually would be a very fine oil mist, not typically coloring product, and you’d see other issues. It’s more probable the product was sensitive to slight warmth or light (did any UV light hit it? Some peptides are light-sensitive). If the process deviated (say shelf overshot setpoint briefly), that could cause it. To pinpoint: analyze the product (HPLC etc.) for signs of breakdown. Meanwhile, refine process: maybe dry at lower temp or shorter time to avoid whatever degradation. Ensure using fresh nitrogen to minimize oxidative stress. Also, sometimes a gentle anneal can reduce nasty interactions in formulation. It might not be the freeze dryer malfunctioning, but rather the cycle needs tweaking or the formulation needs a stabilizer (for example, adding an antioxidant or using amber vials if light is an issue).

**Q6: Can I stop a cycle midway if I realize I made a mistake (for instance, the wrong recipe was started)?**
**A:** Yes, but do it in a controlled way. If you catch the mistake in the very early stage (and product is still unfrozen or just frozen), you can abort and start over. To safely stop: If vacuum is on, first turn off heat (if any) and vent the chamber slowly to avoid disturbing product. Once at atmospheric, you can open up and either refreeze or adjust whatever needed. If the cycle was wrong but conditions were still okay for product (e.g., it was just holding at -40 and you needed a different sequence), the product is likely fine – you can immediately start the correct recipe (you might not even need to unload). But if you vented to fix things, you have to reapply vacuum to continue drying. If the product thawed at all, you must refreeze before resuming vacuum or you’ll get boil over. On the software, to abort you might switch to Manual mode or press an “Abort” if present. Use Manual controls to bring everything to a safe state (stop vacuum, vent, etc.). It’s generally better to salvage a run if possible (especially if an expensive batch) by continuing in manual or adjusting on the fly: for example, if you realized at step 5 that you needed 2 more hours in step 4, you can in some systems extend that step time or pause the step. The Lyo-Pilot may allow editing time remaining on the fly (some PLCs do). If not, the workaround is manual mode control: keep conditions until ready, then maybe skip to next steps manually. These advanced interventions can be tricky, so for beginners, the safer approach is to abort and start fresh correctly, unless product would be irreversibly lost by an abort (most peptides can handle being re-frozen once if needed).

**Q7: Why is my drying time much longer than the recipe predicted?**
**A:** Likely because real conditions differ from assumed. Possible reasons:

* The shelf may not be hitting the set temperature quickly (there’s a lag, especially when product is cooling). If you programmed 1 hour at -40°C, note that maybe the first 0.5 hour was spent just getting to -40. So effectively freezing took longer.
* If vacuum pump performance is a bit lower, sublimation is slower (pressure might have been a tad higher than you thought).
* Heat transfer: if you loaded a lot of vials, edge vs center vials dry at different rates. The recipe might finish when the “average” vial is dry, but edge ones might have dried faster and center slower. If you base time on an edge vial, center ones need more. Best to base on worst-case position (usually center of shelf).
* Conservative safety settings: If Vacuum Heat Upper triggered often, the system may have spent time with heater off, effectively pausing drying until pressure went down. That will lengthen total time.
* Check the History Log for any long holds or stalls (any alarm that might have put system into hold).
* Also, your initial guess on required time might be off. Many freeze-drying cycles, after first trial, are adjusted (e.g., “it took 12 hours for product thermocouple to come up, not 8 as we thought” – so you then know to program 12 or a bit more).
* If the product has high solid content or thick volume, drying is inherently slower (vapor must diffuse through dried layer). Maybe a two-day cycle is just what it needs; trying to force it faster could risk quality. So technology and science factors play a role.
  To improve time, consider: slightly higher primary temp (if safe), better shelving/tray arrangement for airflow, or even using thinner fill volume if possible. But often, once cycle is optimized for quality, the drying time is what it is, and you schedule around that.

### D. Interpreting Graphs and Data

Visual data from the freeze dryer can yield rich insights into the process. Here are tips to interpret the real-time curves and logged data:

**Temperature Graph Interpretation:**

* **Shelf vs Product Temperature:** In the early phase (freezing), shelf temp (black line) drops to setpoint, while product temp (if available, say green line) will drop a bit slower (since product cools with some lag). Once both are at the freeze temp, product may undergo crystallization – sometimes you’ll see a slight bump in product temp due to release of latent heat (exotherm) during crystallization. During primary drying, you’ll see shelf temp rise to the setpoint (e.g., -20°C) while product temp stays lower (maybe -30°C initially) as ice sublimation cools it. As drying progresses, the product temp line will slowly climb. **When product temp converges with shelf temp, it indicates little to no ice left** – a key endpoint signal. The red line (shelf SV) is the target; black (shelf PV) should closely follow it unless the system is at its limits. If shelf PV lags far below SV for a long time, it might indicate either heavy sublimation (cooling the shelf) or a problem with heater capacity.
* **Condenser Temperature:** The blue line for condenser shows how cold the trap is. Ideally, it stays quite low (e.g., below -50°C) throughout primary drying. If you see it rising steadily towards 0°C, expect pressure issues – likely ice saturation. A good stable run might have condenser at -60 initially, ending around -40 by the time all ice is caught. If it gets warmer, consider that a limit reached.
* **Step Transitions:** Each time the recipe advances a step with a new shelf setpoint, you’ll see the Shelf Set (red) jump to the new value. The shelf PV (black) will then move towards it. A **steep climb or drop in black line** indicates either Slope Temp was off (so immediate change) or a very aggressive ramp. A **gradual slope** indicates controlled ramping. Ensure the product temp (green) responds accordingly. A dangerous scenario would be shelf jumping and product not following then suddenly spiking – could mean thermal runaway if product suddenly lost cooling (like all ice gone unexpectedly causing a temp jump).
* **Plateau and Equilibration:** Ideally, near end of primary, the product temp plateaus then rises to meet shelf. The lines flatten out. During secondary, both shelf and product are relatively flat (with product maybe a little lower if still drying moisture, but much closer). If product temp remains significantly lower than shelf even late, it hints at residual ice – maybe you ended primary too early.
* **Noise and Oscillations:** Small oscillations (a few degrees) in shelf PV are usually the PID control maintaining temp. Big swings might mean the PID needs tuning or the system is struggling (like overshoot then correction). For vacuum, oscillation might be a bleed valve cycling.
* **Graph Scales:** Use the time navigation. Zoom out to see entire cycle at once – you’ll identify distinct phases: a flat line at freeze temp, a ramp up to drying temp, then a ramp to secondary temp. It should match your recipe timeline. If something happened out of sequence (like a temp dip in the middle not expected), check if maybe an alarm paused heating.
* **Absolute Clock vs Relative Time:** The graph shows absolute timestamps (actual date/time). For process analysis, you might prefer relative (minutes from start). The software doesn’t directly show that on axes, but you know start time (when step1 began). You can subtract times.

**Vacuum (Pressure) Graph Interpretation:**

* The pressure curve should drop sharply when vacuum starts, then settle around setpoint. If you see a **gradual decline** over hours, that’s normal as the last moisture leaves (pressure may slightly fall further as less vapor load).
* A **sudden spike** in pressure during the run suggests an event: either an intentional vent (if you did stoppering at partial vacuum, you’d see a rise) or a problem (leak or condenser overwhelm). For example, if shelf heat was too high, pressure might spike until control cut it – you’d see a peak then recovery. Corresponding temperature graph might show a deviation at same time.
* If you have controlled pressure (with a valve), the line might have small sawtooth oscillation as the valve opens/closes to maintain setpoint. If you see big oscillations (like pressure swinging between 10 Pa and 100 Pa repeatedly), that’s not ideal – it could indicate tuning issues or even an unstable process (like bumping of product). Check vacuum control settings.
* During secondary drying, pressure often goes to the lowest value. If the pump is good, maybe \~5 Pa. If you see it stuck at, say, 50 Pa when you wanted lower, either the control is keeping it (maybe by setpoint) or there’s a slight leak or pump limitation. That might clue you to check pump performance (maybe oil due).
* After venting, the vacuum graph will shoot to max (top of chart) – obviously, that’s end of process.

**Using Data for Batch Records:**

* Print or export the graphs to include in batch reports if needed. The visual evidence of maintaining low temperature until dryness can be a proof of process control. The logs showing no alarms indicates everything within limits.
* If an alarm did occur, correlating it to the graph can identify cause. E.g., an alarm “Shelf Temp Deviation” at time X – on graph at time X, shelf PV might have overshot SV by > Temp Range. Why? Possibly a big setpoint change or PID overshoot. Knowing that, you might adjust ramp or PID next time.
* Keep an eye on **repeatability**: After several runs, you’ll get a characteristic curve shape for that product. If one day the curves look very different (like pressure is higher than usual, or shelf took longer to reach temp), it may indicate a developing issue (maybe vacuum pump aging or heat transfer issue). Early detection by noticing trends can prompt preventive maintenance.

**Graphical Signs of End of Primary Drying:** (This is so important it bears repeating succinctly)

* Product thermocouple trace rises to meet shelf trace.
* Chamber pressure possibly shows a small step down or becomes easier to maintain.
* If you have multiple product probes, they all start rising, indicating all vials have no ice.
* The “end of drying” can also be seen by doing a **hold test**: if you hold shelf at same temp for an extra hour and product temp doesn’t change further and pressure stays low, you were likely done an hour before – that can inform you to shorten next time.

By mastering interpretation of these graphs, you essentially “look inside” the process in real-time. Over time, you’ll predict issues before alarms – e.g., “the condenser is warming faster than usual, I might need to throttle heat to avoid a pressure spike.” The FD-10F-TP’s recording ability, combined with your analysis, becomes a powerful tool to optimize and ensure quality in your freeze drying cycles.
